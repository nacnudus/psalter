audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment013.flac,10,78,1,7,"Attendite, popule",1,To the intent that when they came up
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment014.flac,10,78,1,7,"Attendite, popule",2,they might shew their children the same;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment015.flac,10,78,1,8,"Attendite, popule",1,That they might put their trust in God
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment016.flac,10,78,1,8,"Attendite, popule",2,"and not to forget the works of God, but to keep his commandments;"

audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment019.flac,10,78,1,10,"Attendite, popule",1,Like as the children of Ephraim
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment020.flac,10,78,1,10,"Attendite, popule",2,"who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment021.flac,10,78,1,11,"Attendite, popule",1,They kept not the covenant of God
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment022.flac,10,78,1,11,"Attendite, popule",2,and would not walk in his law;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment023.flac,10,78,1,12,"Attendite, popule",1,But forgat what he had done
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment024.flac,10,78,1,12,"Attendite, popule",2,and the wonderful works that he had shewed for them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment025.flac,10,78,1,13,"Attendite, popule",1,"Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment026.flac,10,78,1,13,"Attendite, popule",2,even in the field of Zoan.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment027.flac,10,78,1,14,"Attendite, popule",1,"He divided the sea, and let them go through"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment028.flac,10,78,1,14,"Attendite, popule",2,he made the waters to stand on an heap.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment029.flac,10,78,1,15,"Attendite, popule",1,In the day-time also he led them with a cloud
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment030.flac,10,78,1,15,"Attendite, popule",2,and all the night through with a light of fire.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment031.flac,10,78,1,16,"Attendite, popule",1,He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment032.flac,10,78,1,16,"Attendite, popule",2,"and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment033.flac,10,78,1,17,"Attendite, popule",1,He brought waters out of the stony rock
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment034.flac,10,78,1,17,"Attendite, popule",2,so that it gushed out like the rivers.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment035.flac,10,78,1,18,"Attendite, popule",1,Yet for all this they sinned more against him
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment036.flac,10,78,1,18,"Attendite, popule",2,and provoked the most Highest in the wilderness.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment037.flac,10,78,1,19,"Attendite, popule",1,They tempted God in their hearts
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment038.flac,10,78,1,19,"Attendite, popule",2,and required meat for their lust.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment039.flac,10,78,1,20,"Attendite, popule",1,"They spake against God also, saying"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment040.flac,10,78,1,20,"Attendite, popule",2,Shall God prepare a table in the wilderness?
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment041.flac,10,78,1,21,"Attendite, popule",1,"He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams flowed withal"

audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment043.flac,10,78,1,22,"Attendite, popule",1,"When the Lord heard this, he was wroth"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment044.flac,10,78,1,22,"Attendite, popule",2,"so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment045.flac,10,78,1,23,"Attendite, popule",1,Because they believed not in God
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment046.flac,10,78,1,23,"Attendite, popule",2,and put not their trust in his help.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment047.flac,10,78,1,24,"Attendite, popule",1,So he commanded the clouds above
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment048.flac,10,78,1,24,"Attendite, popule",2,and opened the doors of heaven.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment049.flac,10,78,1,25,"Attendite, popule",1,He rained down manna also upon them for to eat
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment050.flac,10,78,1,25,"Attendite, popule",2,and gave them food from heaven.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment051.flac,10,78,1,26,"Attendite, popule",1,So man did eat angels' food
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment052.flac,10,78,1,26,"Attendite, popule",2,for he sent them meat enough.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment053.flac,10,78,1,27,"Attendite, popule",1,He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment054.flac,10,78,1,27,"Attendite, popule",2,and through his power he brought in the south-west-wind.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment055.flac,10,78,1,28,"Attendite, popule",1,He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment056.flac,10,78,1,28,"Attendite, popule",2,and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment057.flac,10,78,1,29,"Attendite, popule",1,He let it fall among their tents
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment058.flac,10,78,1,29,"Attendite, popule",2,even round about their habitation.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment059.flac,10,78,1,30,"Attendite, popule",1,"So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment060.flac,10,78,1,30,"Attendite, popule",2,they were not disappointed of their lust.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment061.flac,10,78,1,31,"Attendite, popule",1,"But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment062.flac,10,78,1,31,"Attendite, popule",2,"yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment063.flac,10,78,1,32,"Attendite, popule",1,But for all this they sinned yet more
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment064.flac,10,78,1,32,"Attendite, popule",2,and believed not his wondrous works.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment065.flac,10,78,1,33,"Attendite, popule",1,Therefore their days did he consume in vanity
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment066.flac,10,78,1,33,"Attendite, popule",2,and their years in trouble.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment067.flac,10,78,1,34,"Attendite, popule",1,"When he slew them, they sought him"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment068.flac,10,78,1,34,"Attendite, popule",2,"and turned them early, and inquired after God."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment069.flac,10,78,1,35,"Attendite, popule",1,And they remembered that God was their strength
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment070.flac,10,78,1,35,"Attendite, popule",2,and that the high God was their redeemer.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment071.flac,10,78,1,36,"Attendite, popule",1,"Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment072.flac,10,78,1,36,"Attendite, popule",2,and dissembled with him in their tongue.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment073.flac,10,78,1,37,"Attendite, popule",1,For their heart was not whole with him
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment074.flac,10,78,1,37,"Attendite, popule",2,neither continued they stedfast in his covenant.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment075.flac,10,78,1,38,"Attendite, popule",1,"But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment076.flac,10,78,1,38,"Attendite, popule",2,and destroyed them not.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment077.flac,10,78,1,39,"Attendite, popule",1,"Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment078.flac,10,78,1,39,"Attendite, popule",2,and would not suffer his whole displeasure to arise.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment079.flac,10,78,1,40,"Attendite, popule",1,For he considered that they were but flesh
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment080.flac,10,78,1,40,"Attendite, popule",2,"and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment081.flac,10,78,1,41,"Attendite, popule",1,Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment082.flac,10,78,1,41,"Attendite, popule",2,and grieved him in the desert.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment083.flac,10,78,1,42,"Attendite, popule",1,"They turned back, and tempted God"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment084.flac,10,78,1,42,"Attendite, popule",2,and moved the Holy One in Israel.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment085.flac,10,78,1,43,"Attendite, popule",1,They thought not of his hand
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment086.flac,10,78,1,43,"Attendite, popule",2,and of the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment087.flac,10,78,1,44,"Attendite, popule",1,How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment088.flac,10,78,1,44,"Attendite, popule",2,and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment089.flac,10,78,1,45,"Attendite, popule",1,He turned their waters into blood
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment090.flac,10,78,1,45,"Attendite, popule",2,so that they might not drink of the rivers.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment091.flac,10,78,1,46,"Attendite, popule",1,"He sent lice among them, and devoured them up"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment092.flac,10,78,1,46,"Attendite, popule",2,and frogs to destroy them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment093.flac,10,78,1,47,"Attendite, popule",1,He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment094.flac,10,78,1,47,"Attendite, popule",2,and their labour unto the grasshopper.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment095.flac,10,78,1,48,"Attendite, popule",1,He destroyed their vines with hail-stones
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment096.flac,10,78,1,48,"Attendite, popule",2,and their mulberry trees with the frost.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment097.flac,10,78,1,49,"Attendite, popule",1,He smote their cattle also with hail-stones
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment098.flac,10,78,1,49,"Attendite, popule",2,and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment099.flac,10,78,1,50,"Attendite, popule",1,"He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and trouble"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment100.flac,10,78,1,50,"Attendite, popule",2,and sent evil angels among them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment101.flac,10,78,1,51,"Attendite, popule",1,"He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment102.flac,10,78,1,51,"Attendite, popule",2,but gave their life over to the pestilence;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment103.flac,10,78,1,52,"Attendite, popule",1,And smote all the first-born in Egypt
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment104.flac,10,78,1,52,"Attendite, popule",2,the most principal and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment105.flac,10,78,1,53,"Attendite, popule",1,"But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment106.flac,10,78,1,53,"Attendite, popule",2,and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment107.flac,10,78,1,54,"Attendite, popule",1,"He brought them out safely, that they should not fear"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment108.flac,10,78,1,54,"Attendite, popule",2,and overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment109.flac,10,78,1,55,"Attendite, popule",1,And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment110.flac,10,78,1,55,"Attendite, popule",2,even to his mountain which he purchased with his right hand.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment111.flac,10,78,1,56,"Attendite, popule",1,He cast out the heathen also before them
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment112.flac,10,78,1,56,"Attendite, popule",2,"caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment113.flac,10,78,1,57,"Attendite, popule",1,So they tempted and displeased the most high God
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment114.flac,10,78,1,57,"Attendite, popule",2,and kept not his testimonies;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment115.flac,10,78,1,58,"Attendite, popule",1,"But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment116.flac,10,78,1,58,"Attendite, popule",2,starting aside like a broken bow.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment117.flac,10,78,1,59,"Attendite, popule",1,For they grieved him with their hill-altars
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment118.flac,10,78,1,59,"Attendite, popule",2,and provoked him to displeasure with their images.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment119.flac,10,78,1,60,"Attendite, popule",1,"When God heard this, he was wroth"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment120.flac,10,78,1,60,"Attendite, popule",2,and took sore displeasure at Israel.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment121.flac,10,78,1,61,"Attendite, popule",1,So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment122.flac,10,78,1,61,"Attendite, popule",2,even the tent that he had pitched among men.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment123.flac,10,78,1,62,"Attendite, popule",1,He delivered their power into captivity
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment124.flac,10,78,1,62,"Attendite, popule",2,and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment125.flac,10,78,1,63,"Attendite, popule",1,He gave his people over also unto the sword
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment126.flac,10,78,1,63,"Attendite, popule",2,and was wroth with his inheritance.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment127.flac,10,78,1,64,"Attendite, popule",1,The fire consumed their young men
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment128.flac,10,78,1,64,"Attendite, popule",2,and their maidens were not given to marriage.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment129.flac,10,78,1,65,"Attendite, popule",1,Their priests were slain with the sword
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment130.flac,10,78,1,65,"Attendite, popule",2,and there were no widows to make lamentation.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment131.flac,10,78,1,66,"Attendite, popule",1,So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment132.flac,10,78,1,66,"Attendite, popule",2,and like a giant refreshed with wine.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment133.flac,10,78,1,67,"Attendite, popule",1,He smote his enemies in the hinder parts
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment134.flac,10,78,1,67,"Attendite, popule",2,and put them to a perpetual shame.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment135.flac,10,78,1,68,"Attendite, popule",1,He refused the tabernacle of Joseph
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment136.flac,10,78,1,68,"Attendite, popule",2,and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment137.flac,10,78,1,69,"Attendite, popule",1,But chose the tribe of Judah
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment138.flac,10,78,1,69,"Attendite, popule",2,even the hill of Sion which he loved.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment139.flac,10,78,1,70,"Attendite, popule",1,And there he built his temple on high
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment140.flac,10,78,1,70,"Attendite, popule",2,and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath made continually.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment141.flac,10,78,1,71,"Attendite, popule",1,He chose David also his servant
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment142.flac,10,78,1,71,"Attendite, popule",2,and took him away from the sheep-folds.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment143.flac,10,78,1,72,"Attendite, popule",1,As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment144.flac,10,78,1,72,"Attendite, popule",2,"that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment145.flac,10,78,1,73,"Attendite, popule",1,So he fed them with a faithful and true heart
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc06/track10/segment146.flac,10,78,1,73,"Attendite, popule",2,and ruled them prudently with all his power.

audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment032.flac,01,105,1,16,Confitemini Domino,2,and destroyed all the provision of bread.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment033.flac,01,105,1,17,Confitemini Domino,1,But he had sent a man before them
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment034.flac,01,105,1,17,Confitemini Domino,2,"even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servant;"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment035.flac,01,105,1,18,Confitemini Domino,1,Whose feet they hurt in the stocks
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment036.flac,01,105,1,18,Confitemini Domino,2,the iron entered into his soul;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment037.flac,01,105,1,19,Confitemini Domino,1,Until the time came that his cause was known
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment038.flac,01,105,1,19,Confitemini Domino,2,the word of the Lord tried him.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment039.flac,01,105,1,20,Confitemini Domino,1,"The king sent, and delivered him"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment040.flac,01,105,1,20,Confitemini Domino,2,the prince of the people let him go free.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment041.flac,01,105,1,21,Confitemini Domino,1,He made him lord also of his house
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment042.flac,01,105,1,21,Confitemini Domino,2,and ruler of all his substance;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment043.flac,01,105,1,22,Confitemini Domino,1,That he might inform his princes after his will
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment044.flac,01,105,1,22,Confitemini Domino,2,and teach his senators wisdom.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment045.flac,01,105,1,23,Confitemini Domino,1,Israel also came into Egypt
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment046.flac,01,105,1,23,Confitemini Domino,2,and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment047.flac,01,105,1,24,Confitemini Domino,1,And he increased his people exceedingly
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment048.flac,01,105,1,24,Confitemini Domino,2,and made them stronger than their enemies;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment049.flac,01,105,1,25,Confitemini Domino,1,"Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment050.flac,01,105,1,25,Confitemini Domino,2,and dealt untruly with his servants.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment051.flac,01,105,1,26,Confitemini Domino,1,Then sent he Moses his servant
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment052.flac,01,105,1,26,Confitemini Domino,2,and Aaron whom he had chosen.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment053.flac,01,105,1,27,Confitemini Domino,1,And these shewed his tokens among them
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment054.flac,01,105,1,27,Confitemini Domino,2,and wonders in the land of Ham.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment055.flac,01,105,1,28,Confitemini Domino,1,"He sent darkness, and it was dark"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment056.flac,01,105,1,28,Confitemini Domino,2,and they were not obedient unto his word.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment057.flac,01,105,1,29,Confitemini Domino,1,He turned their waters into blood
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment058.flac,01,105,1,29,Confitemini Domino,2,and slew their fish.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment059.flac,01,105,1,30,Confitemini Domino,1,Their land brought forth frogs
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment060.flac,01,105,1,30,Confitemini Domino,2,"yea, even in their kings' chambers."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment061.flac,01,105,1,31,Confitemini Domino,1,"He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment062.flac,01,105,1,31,Confitemini Domino,2,and lice in all their quarters.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment063.flac,01,105,1,32,Confitemini Domino,1,He gave them hail-stones for rain
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment064.flac,01,105,1,32,Confitemini Domino,2,and flames of fire in their land.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment065.flac,01,105,1,33,Confitemini Domino,1,He smote their vines also and fig-trees
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment066.flac,01,105,1,33,Confitemini Domino,2,and destroyed the trees that were in their coasts.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment067.flac,01,105,1,34,Confitemini Domino,1,"He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment068.flac,01,105,1,34,Confitemini Domino,2,"and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment069.flac,01,105,1,35,Confitemini Domino,1,He smote all the first-born in their land
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment070.flac,01,105,1,35,Confitemini Domino,2,even the chief of all their strength.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment071.flac,01,105,1,36,Confitemini Domino,1,He brought them forth also with silver and gold
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment072.flac,01,105,1,36,Confitemini Domino,2,there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment073.flac,01,105,1,37,Confitemini Domino,1,Egypt was glad at their departing
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment074.flac,01,105,1,37,Confitemini Domino,2,for they were afraid of them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment075.flac,01,105,1,38,Confitemini Domino,1,He spread out a cloud to be a covering
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment076.flac,01,105,1,38,Confitemini Domino,2,and fire to give light in the night-season.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment077.flac,01,105,1,39,Confitemini Domino,1,At their desire he brought quails
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment078.flac,01,105,1,39,Confitemini Domino,2,and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment079.flac,01,105,1,40,Confitemini Domino,1,"He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment080.flac,01,105,1,40,Confitemini Domino,2,so that rivers ran in the dry places.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment081.flac,01,105,1,41,Confitemini Domino,1,For why? he remembered his holy promise
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment082.flac,01,105,1,41,Confitemini Domino,2,and Abraham his servant.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment083.flac,01,105,1,42,Confitemini Domino,1,And he brought forth his people with joy
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment084.flac,01,105,1,42,Confitemini Domino,2,and his chosen with gladness;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment085.flac,01,105,1,43,Confitemini Domino,1,And gave them the lands of the heathen
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment086.flac,01,105,1,43,Confitemini Domino,2,and they took the labours of the people in possession;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment087.flac,01,105,1,44,Confitemini Domino,1,That they might keep his statutes
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment088.flac,01,105,1,44,Confitemini Domino,2,and observe his laws.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment089.flac,01,105,,,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment090.flac,01,105,,,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"

audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track01/segment093.flac,01,105,,,Doxology,2,
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment000.flac,02,106,1,1,Confitemini Domino,1,
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment001.flac,02,106,1,1,Confitemini Domino,1,"O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment002.flac,02,106,1,1,Confitemini Domino,2,and his mercy endureth for ever.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment003.flac,02,106,1,2,Confitemini Domino,1,Who can express the noble acts of the Lord
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment004.flac,02,106,1,2,Confitemini Domino,2,or shew forth all his praise?
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment005.flac,02,106,1,3,Confitemini Domino,1,Blessed are they that alway keep judgement
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment006.flac,02,106,1,3,Confitemini Domino,2,and do righteousness.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment007.flac,02,106,1,4,Confitemini Domino,1,"Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy people"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment008.flac,02,106,1,4,Confitemini Domino,2,O visit me with thy salvation;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment009.flac,02,106,1,5,Confitemini Domino,1,That I may see the felicity of thy chosen
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment010.flac,02,106,1,5,Confitemini Domino,2,"and rejoice in the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment011.flac,02,106,1,6,Confitemini Domino,1,We have sinned with our fathers
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment012.flac,02,106,1,6,Confitemini Domino,2,"we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment013.flac,02,106,1,7,Confitemini Domino,1,"Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness in remembrance"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment014.flac,02,106,1,7,Confitemini Domino,2,"but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red sea."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment015.flac,02,106,1,8,Confitemini Domino,1,"Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment016.flac,02,106,1,8,Confitemini Domino,2,that he might make his power to be known.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment017.flac,02,106,1,9,Confitemini Domino,1,"He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment018.flac,02,106,1,9,Confitemini Domino,2,"so he led them through the deep, as through a wilderness."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment019.flac,02,106,1,10,Confitemini Domino,1,And he saved them from the adversaries' hand
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment020.flac,02,106,1,10,Confitemini Domino,2,and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment021.flac,02,106,1,11,Confitemini Domino,1,"As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment022.flac,02,106,1,11,Confitemini Domino,2,there was not one of them left.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment023.flac,02,106,1,12,Confitemini Domino,1,Then believed they his words
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment024.flac,02,106,1,12,Confitemini Domino,2,and sang praise unto him.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment025.flac,02,106,1,13,Confitemini Domino,1,But within a while they forgat his works
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment026.flac,02,106,1,13,Confitemini Domino,2,and would not abide his counsel.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment027.flac,02,106,1,14,Confitemini Domino,1,But lust came upon them in the wilderness
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment028.flac,02,106,1,14,Confitemini Domino,2,and they tempted God in the desert.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment029.flac,02,106,1,15,Confitemini Domino,1,And he gave them their desire
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment030.flac,02,106,1,15,Confitemini Domino,2,and sent leanness withal into their soul.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment031.flac,02,106,1,16,Confitemini Domino,1,They angered Moses also in the tents
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment032.flac,02,106,1,16,Confitemini Domino,2,and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment033.flac,02,106,1,17,Confitemini Domino,1,"So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment034.flac,02,106,1,17,Confitemini Domino,2,and covered the congregation of Abiram.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment035.flac,02,106,1,18,Confitemini Domino,1,And the fire was kindled in their company
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment036.flac,02,106,1,18,Confitemini Domino,2,the flame burnt up the ungodly.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment037.flac,02,106,1,19,Confitemini Domino,1,They made a calf in Horeb
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment038.flac,02,106,1,19,Confitemini Domino,2,and worshipped the molten image.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment039.flac,02,106,1,20,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus they turned their glory
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment040.flac,02,106,1,20,Confitemini Domino,2,into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment041.flac,02,106,1,21,Confitemini Domino,1,And they forgat God their Saviour
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment042.flac,02,106,1,21,Confitemini Domino,2,who had done so great things in Egypt;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment043.flac,02,106,1,22,Confitemini Domino,1,Wondrous works in the land of Ham
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment044.flac,02,106,1,22,Confitemini Domino,2,and fearful things by the Red sea.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment045.flac,02,106,1,23,Confitemini Domino,1,"So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment046.flac,02,106,1,23,Confitemini Domino,2,"to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them."
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment047.flac,02,106,1,24,Confitemini Domino,1,"Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment048.flac,02,106,1,24,Confitemini Domino,2,and gave no credence unto his word;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment049.flac,02,106,1,25,Confitemini Domino,1,But murmured in their tents
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment050.flac,02,106,1,25,Confitemini Domino,2,and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment051.flac,02,106,1,26,Confitemini Domino,1,Then lift he up his hand against them
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment052.flac,02,106,1,26,Confitemini Domino,2,to overthrow them in the wilderness;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment053.flac,02,106,1,27,Confitemini Domino,1,To cast out their seed among the nations
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment054.flac,02,106,1,27,Confitemini Domino,2,and to scatter them in the lands.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment055.flac,02,106,1,28,Confitemini Domino,1,They joined themselves unto Baal-peor
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment056.flac,02,106,1,28,Confitemini Domino,2,and ate the offerings of the dead.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment057.flac,02,106,1,29,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment058.flac,02,106,1,29,Confitemini Domino,2,and the plague was great among them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment059.flac,02,106,1,30,Confitemini Domino,1,Then stood up Phinees and prayed
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment060.flac,02,106,1,30,Confitemini Domino,2,and so the plague ceased.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment061.flac,02,106,1,31,Confitemini Domino,1,And that was counted unto him for righteousness
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment062.flac,02,106,1,31,Confitemini Domino,2,among all posterities for evermore.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment063.flac,02,106,1,32,Confitemini Domino,1,They angered him also at the waters of strife
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment064.flac,02,106,1,32,Confitemini Domino,2,so that he punished Moses for their sakes;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment065.flac,02,106,1,33,Confitemini Domino,1,Because they provoked his spirit
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment066.flac,02,106,1,33,Confitemini Domino,2,so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment067.flac,02,106,1,34,Confitemini Domino,1,Neither destroyed they the heathen
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment068.flac,02,106,1,34,Confitemini Domino,2,as the Lord commanded them;
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment069.flac,02,106,1,35,Confitemini Domino,1,But were mingled among the heathen
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment070.flac,02,106,1,35,Confitemini Domino,2,and learned their works.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment071.flac,02,106,1,36,Confitemini Domino,1,"Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment072.flac,02,106,1,36,Confitemini Domino,2,"yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment073.flac,02,106,1,37,Confitemini Domino,1,"And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters"
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment074.flac,02,106,1,37,Confitemini Domino,2,whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment075.flac,02,106,1,38,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus were they stained with their own works
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment076.flac,02,106,1,38,Confitemini Domino,2,and went a whoring with their own inventions.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment077.flac,02,106,1,39,Confitemini Domino,1,Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment078.flac,02,106,1,39,Confitemini Domino,2,insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment079.flac,02,106,1,40,Confitemini Domino,1,And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment080.flac,02,106,1,40,Confitemini Domino,2,and they that hated them were lords over them.
audio/st-pauls-scott/disc09/track02/segment081.flac,02,106,1,41,Confitemini Domino,1,Their enemies oppressed them
