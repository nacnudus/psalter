18,1,34,"Diligam te, Domine",1,He teacheth mine hands to fight
18,1,34,"Diligam te, Domine",2,and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
18,1,35,"Diligam te, Domine",1,Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation
18,1,35,"Diligam te, Domine",2,"thy right hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great."
18,1,36,"Diligam te, Domine",1,Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go
18,1,36,"Diligam te, Domine",2,that my footsteps shall not slide.
18,1,37,"Diligam te, Domine",1,"I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them"
18,1,37,"Diligam te, Domine",2,neither will I turn again till I have destroyed them.
18,1,38,"Diligam te, Domine",1,"I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand"
18,1,38,"Diligam te, Domine",2,but fall under my feet.
18,1,39,"Diligam te, Domine",1,Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle
18,1,39,"Diligam te, Domine",2,thou shalt throw down mine enemies under me.
18,1,40,"Diligam te, Domine",1,Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me
18,1,40,"Diligam te, Domine",2,and I shall destroy them that hate me.
18,1,41,"Diligam te, Domine",1,"They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them"
18,1,41,"Diligam te, Domine",2,"yea, even unto the Lord shall they cry, but he shall not hear them."
18,1,42,"Diligam te, Domine",1,I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind
18,1,42,"Diligam te, Domine",2,I will cast them out as the clay in the streets.

34,1,7,Benedicam Domino,2,and delivereth them.
34,1,8,Benedicam Domino,1,"O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is"
34,1,8,Benedicam Domino,2,blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
34,1,9,Benedicam Domino,1,"O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints"
34,1,9,Benedicam Domino,2,for they that fear him lack nothing.
34,1,10,Benedicam Domino,1,"The lions do lack, and suffer hunger"
34,1,10,Benedicam Domino,2,but they who seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good.
34,1,11,Benedicam Domino,1,"Come, ye children, and hearken unto me"
34,1,11,Benedicam Domino,2,I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
34,1,12,Benedicam Domino,1,What man is he that lusteth to live
34,1,12,Benedicam Domino,2,and would fain see good days?
34,1,13,Benedicam Domino,1,Keep thy tongue from evil
34,1,13,Benedicam Domino,2,"and thy lips, that they speak no guile."
34,1,14,Benedicam Domino,1,"Eschew evil, and do good"
34,1,14,Benedicam Domino,2,"seek peace, and ensue it."
34,1,15,Benedicam Domino,1,The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous
34,1,15,Benedicam Domino,2,and his ears are open unto their prayers.
34,1,16,Benedicam Domino,1,The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil
34,1,16,Benedicam Domino,2,to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.
34,1,17,Benedicam Domino,1,"The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them"
34,1,17,Benedicam Domino,2,and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
34,1,18,Benedicam Domino,1,The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart
34,1,18,Benedicam Domino,2,and will save such as be of an humble spirit.
34,1,19,Benedicam Domino,1,Great are the troubles of the righteous
34,1,19,Benedicam Domino,2,but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
34,1,20,Benedicam Domino,1,He keepeth all his bones
34,1,20,Benedicam Domino,2,so that not one of them is broken.
34,1,21,Benedicam Domino,1,But misfortune shall slay the ungodly
34,1,21,Benedicam Domino,2,and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
34,1,22,Benedicam Domino,1,The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants
34,1,22,Benedicam Domino,2,and all they that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.

35,1,1,"Judica, Domine",1,"PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me"
35,1,1,"Judica, Domine",2,and fight thou against them that fight against me.
35,1,2,"Judica, Domine",1,Lay hand upon the shield and buckler
35,1,2,"Judica, Domine",2,and stand up to help me.
35,1,3,"Judica, Domine",1,"Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me"
35,1,3,"Judica, Domine",2,"say unto my soul, I am thy salvation."

35,1,4,"Judica, Domine",2,"let them be turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me."
35,1,5,"Judica, Domine",1,Let them be as the dust before the wind

35,1,6,"Judica, Domine",2,and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
35,1,7,"Judica, Domine",1,For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause
35,1,7,"Judica, Domine",2,"yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul."
35,1,8,"Judica, Domine",1,"Let a sudden destruction come upon him un-awares, and his net, that he hath laid privily, catch himself"
35,1,8,"Judica, Domine",2,that he may fall into his own mischief.

35,1,10,"Judica, Domine",2,"yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?"
35,1,11,"Judica, Domine",1,False witnesses did rise up
35,1,11,"Judica, Domine",2,they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
35,1,12,"Judica, Domine",1,They rewarded me evil for good
35,1,12,"Judica, Domine",2,to the great discomfort of my soul.
35,1,13,"Judica, Domine",1,"Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting"
35,1,13,"Judica, Domine",2,and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
35,1,14,"Judica, Domine",1,I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother
35,1,14,"Judica, Domine",2,"I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother."
35,1,15,"Judica, Domine",1,"But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together"
35,1,15,"Judica, Domine",2,"yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me, and ceased not."
35,1,16,"Judica, Domine",1,With the flatterers were busy mockers
35,1,16,"Judica, Domine",2,who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
35,1,17,"Judica, Domine",1,"Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this"
35,1,17,"Judica, Domine",2,"O deliver my soul from the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions."
35,1,18,"Judica, Domine",1,So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation
35,1,18,"Judica, Domine",2,I will praise thee among much people.
35,1,19,"Judica, Domine",1,O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly
35,1,19,"Judica, Domine",2,neither let them wink with their eyes that hate me without a cause.
35,1,20,"Judica, Domine",1,And why? their communing is not for peace
35,1,20,"Judica, Domine",2,but they imagine deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.
35,1,21,"Judica, Domine",1,"They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said"
35,1,21,"Judica, Domine",2,"Fie on thee, fie on thee, we saw it with our eyes."
35,1,22,"Judica, Domine",1,"This thou hast seen, O Lord"

35,1,27,"Judica, Domine",1,"Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing"
35,1,27,"Judica, Domine",2,"yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant."
35,1,28,"Judica, Domine",1,"And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness"

36,1,1,Dixit injustus,1,MY heart sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly
36,1,1,Dixit injustus,2,that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
36,1,2,Dixit injustus,1,For he flattereth himself in his own sight
36,1,2,Dixit injustus,2,until his abominable sin be found out.
36,1,3,Dixit injustus,1,"The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit"
36,1,3,Dixit injustus,2,"he hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good."
36,1,4,Dixit injustus,1,"He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way"
36,1,4,Dixit injustus,2,neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
36,1,5,Dixit injustus,1,"Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens"
36,1,5,Dixit injustus,2,and thy faithfulness unto the clouds.
36,1,6,Dixit injustus,1,Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains
36,1,6,Dixit injustus,2,thy judgements are like the great deep.
36,1,7,Dixit injustus,1,"Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God"
36,1,7,Dixit injustus,2,and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
36,1,8,Dixit injustus,1,They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house
36,1,8,Dixit injustus,2,"and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river."
36,1,9,Dixit injustus,1,For with thee is the well of life
36,1,9,Dixit injustus,2,and in thy light shall we see light.
36,1,10,Dixit injustus,1,O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee
36,1,10,Dixit injustus,2,and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
36,1,11,Dixit injustus,1,O let not the foot of pride come against me
36,1,11,Dixit injustus,2,and let not the hand of the ungodly cast me down.
36,1,12,Dixit injustus,1,"There are they fallen, all that work wickedness"

37,1,1,Noli aemulari,1,FRET not thyself because of the ungodly
37,1,1,Noli aemulari,2,neither be thou envious against the evil-doers.
37,1,2,Noli aemulari,1,For they shall soon be cut down like the grass
37,1,2,Noli aemulari,2,and be withered even as the green herb.
37,1,3,Noli aemulari,1,"Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good"

37,1,4,Noli aemulari,1,Delight thou in the Lord
37,1,4,Noli aemulari,2,and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
37,1,5,Noli aemulari,1,"Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him"
37,1,5,Noli aemulari,2,and he shall bring it to pass.
37,1,6,Noli aemulari,1,He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light
37,1,6,Noli aemulari,2,and thy just dealing as the noon-day.
37,1,7,Noli aemulari,1,"Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him"

37,1,11,Noli aemulari,2,and shall be refreshed in the multitude of peace.
37,1,12,Noli aemulari,1,The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just
37,1,12,Noli aemulari,2,and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
37,1,13,Noli aemulari,1,The Lord shall laugh him to scorn
37,1,13,Noli aemulari,2,for he hath seen that his day is coming.
37,1,14,Noli aemulari,1,"The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow"
37,1,14,Noli aemulari,2,"to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation."
37,1,15,Noli aemulari,1,Their sword shall go through their own heart
37,1,15,Noli aemulari,2,and their bow shall be broken.
37,1,16,Noli aemulari,1,A small thing that the righteous hath
37,1,16,Noli aemulari,2,is better than great riches of the ungodly.
37,1,17,Noli aemulari,1,For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken
37,1,17,Noli aemulari,2,and the Lord upholdeth the righteous.
37,1,18,Noli aemulari,1,The Lord knoweth the days of the godly
37,1,18,Noli aemulari,2,and their inheritance shall endure for ever.
37,1,19,Noli aemulari,1,They shall not be confounded in the perilous time
37,1,19,Noli aemulari,2,and in the days of dearth they shall have enough.
37,1,20,Noli aemulari,1,"As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume as the fat of lambs"
37,1,20,Noli aemulari,2,"yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away."
37,1,21,Noli aemulari,1,"The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again"
37,1,21,Noli aemulari,2,but the righteous is merciful and liberal.
37,1,22,Noli aemulari,1,Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land
37,1,22,Noli aemulari,2,and they that are cursed of him shall be rooted out.
37,1,23,Noli aemulari,1,The Lord ordereth a good man's going
37,1,23,Noli aemulari,2,and maketh his way acceptable to himself.
37,1,24,Noli aemulari,1,"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away"
37,1,24,Noli aemulari,2,for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
37,1,25,Noli aemulari,1,"I have been young, and now am old"
37,1,25,Noli aemulari,2,"and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread."
37,1,26,Noli aemulari,1,"The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth"
37,1,26,Noli aemulari,2,and his seed is blessed.
37,1,27,Noli aemulari,1,"Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good"
37,1,27,Noli aemulari,2,and dwell for evermore.
37,1,28,Noli aemulari,1,For the Lord loveth the thing that is right
37,1,28,Noli aemulari,2,"he forsaketh not his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever."
37,1,29,Noli aemulari,1,The unrighteous shall be punished
37,1,29,Noli aemulari,2,"as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be rooted out."
37,1,30,Noli aemulari,1,The righteous shall inherit the land
37,1,30,Noli aemulari,2,and dwell therein for ever.
37,1,31,Noli aemulari,1,The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom
37,1,31,Noli aemulari,2,and his tongue will be talking of judgement.
37,1,32,Noli aemulari,1,The law of his God is in his heart
37,1,32,Noli aemulari,2,and his goings shall not slide.
37,1,33,Noli aemulari,1,The ungodly seeth the righteous
37,1,33,Noli aemulari,2,and seeketh occasion to slay him.
37,1,34,Noli aemulari,1,The Lord will not leave him in his hand
37,1,34,Noli aemulari,2,nor condemn him when he is judged.
37,1,35,Noli aemulari,1,"Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou shalt possess the land"
37,1,35,Noli aemulari,2,"when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it."
37,1,36,Noli aemulari,1,I myself have seen the ungodly in great power
37,1,36,Noli aemulari,2,and flourishing like a green bay-tree.
37,1,37,Noli aemulari,1,"I went by, and lo, he was gone"
37,1,37,Noli aemulari,2,"I sought him, but his place could no where be found."
37,1,38,Noli aemulari,1,"Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right"
37,1,38,Noli aemulari,2,for that shall bring a man peace at the last.
37,1,39,Noli aemulari,1,"As for the transgressors, they shall perish together"
37,1,39,Noli aemulari,2,"and the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last."
37,1,40,Noli aemulari,1,But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord
37,1,40,Noli aemulari,2,who is also their strength in the time of trouble.
37,1,41,Noli aemulari,1,"And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them"
37,1,41,Noli aemulari,2,"he shall deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him."

38,1,1,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger"
38,1,1,"Domine, ne in furore",2,neither chasten me in thy heavy displeasure.
38,1,2,"Domine, ne in furore",1,For thine arrows stick fast in me
38,1,2,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and thy hand presseth me sore.
38,1,3,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure"
38,1,3,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin."
38,1,4,"Domine, ne in furore",1,For my wickednesses are gone over my head
38,1,4,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"and are like a sore burden, too heavy for me to bear."
38,1,5,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"My wounds stink, and are corrupt"
38,1,5,"Domine, ne in furore",2,through my foolishness.
38,1,6,"Domine, ne in furore",1,I am brought into so great trouble and misery
38,1,6,"Domine, ne in furore",2,that I go mourning all the day long.
38,1,7,"Domine, ne in furore",1,For my loins are filled with a sore disease
38,1,7,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and there is no whole part in my body.
38,1,8,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"I am feeble, and sore smitten"
38,1,8,"Domine, ne in furore",2,I have roared for the very disquietness of my heart.
38,1,9,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"Lord, thou knowest all my desire"
38,1,9,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and my groaning is not hid from thee.
38,1,10,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me"
38,1,10,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and the sight of mine eyes is gone from me.
38,1,11,"Domine, ne in furore",1,My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble
38,1,11,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and my kinsmen stood afar off.
38,1,12,"Domine, ne in furore",1,They also that sought after my life laid snares for me
38,1,12,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long."
38,1,13,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not"
38,1,13,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"and as one that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth."
38,1,14,"Domine, ne in furore",1,I became even as a man that heareth not
38,1,14,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
38,1,15,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust"
38,1,15,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my God."
38,1,16,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph over me"
38,1,16,"Domine, ne in furore",2,"for when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me."
38,1,17,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"And I, truly, am set in the plague"
38,1,17,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
38,1,18,"Domine, ne in furore",1,For I will confess my wickedness
38,1,18,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and be sorry for my sin.
38,1,19,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"But mine enemies live, and are mighty"
38,1,19,"Domine, ne in furore",2,and they that hate me wrongfully are many in number.
38,1,20,"Domine, ne in furore",1,They also that reward evil for good are against me
38,1,20,"Domine, ne in furore",2,because I follow the thing that good is.
38,1,21,"Domine, ne in furore",1,"Forsake me not, O Lord my God"
38,1,21,"Domine, ne in furore",2,be not thou far from me.
38,1,22,"Domine, ne in furore",1,Haste thee to help me

39,1,2,"Dixi, Custodiam",2,while the ungodly is in my sight.
39,1,3,"Dixi, Custodiam",1,"I held my tongue, and spake nothing"
39,1,3,"Dixi, Custodiam",2,"I kept silence, yea, even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me."
39,1,4,"Dixi, Custodiam",1,"My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled"
39,1,4,"Dixi, Custodiam",2,and at the last I spake with my tongue;
39,1,5,"Dixi, Custodiam",1,"Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days"
39,1,5,"Dixi, Custodiam",2,that I may be certified how long I have to live.
39,1,6,"Dixi, Custodiam",1,"Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long"
39,1,6,"Dixi, Custodiam",2,and mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.

48,1,3,Magnus Dominus,2,"are gathered, and gone by together."
48,1,4,Magnus Dominus,1,They marvelled to see such things
48,1,4,Magnus Dominus,2,"they were astonished, and suddenly cast down."
48,1,5,Magnus Dominus,1,"Fear came there upon them, and sorrow"
48,1,5,Magnus Dominus,2,as upon a woman in her travail.
48,1,6,Magnus Dominus,1,Thou shalt break the ships of the sea

49,1,2,"Audite haec, omnes",2,one with another.
49,1,3,"Audite haec, omnes",1,My mouth shall speak of wisdom
49,1,3,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and my heart shall muse of understanding.
49,1,4,"Audite haec, omnes",1,I will incline mine ear to the parable
49,1,4,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
49,1,5,"Audite haec, omnes",1,Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness
49,1,5,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and when the wickedness of my heels compasseth me round about?
49,1,6,"Audite haec, omnes",1,There be some that put their trust in their goods
49,1,6,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.
49,1,7,"Audite haec, omnes",1,But no man may deliver his brother
49,1,7,"Audite haec, omnes",2,nor make agreement unto God for him;
49,1,8,"Audite haec, omnes",1,For it cost more to redeem their souls
49,1,8,"Audite haec, omnes",2,so that he must let that alone for ever;
49,1,9,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"Yea, though he live long"
49,1,9,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and see not the grave.
49,1,10,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together"
49,1,10,"Audite haec, omnes",2,"as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other."
49,1,11,"Audite haec, omnes",1,And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever
49,1,11,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the lands after their own names.
49,1,12,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour"
49,1,12,"Audite haec, omnes",2,seeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
49,1,13,"Audite haec, omnes",1,This is their foolishness
49,1,13,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and their posterity praise their saying.
49,1,14,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall have domination over them in the morning"
49,1,14,"Audite haec, omnes",2,their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
49,1,15,"Audite haec, omnes",1,But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell
49,1,15,"Audite haec, omnes",2,for he shall receive me.
49,1,16,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich"
49,1,16,"Audite haec, omnes",2,or if the glory of his house be increased;
49,1,17,"Audite haec, omnes",1,For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth
49,1,17,"Audite haec, omnes",2,neither shall his pomp follow him.
49,1,18,"Audite haec, omnes",1,"For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man"
49,1,18,"Audite haec, omnes",2,"and so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee."
49,1,19,"Audite haec, omnes",1,He shall follow the generation of his fathers
49,1,19,"Audite haec, omnes",2,and shall never see light.
49,1,20,"Audite haec, omnes",1,Man being in honour hath no understanding
49,1,20,"Audite haec, omnes",2,but is compared unto the beasts that perish.

50,1,5,Deus deorum,1,Gather my saints together unto me
50,1,5,Deus deorum,2,those that have made a covenant with me with sacrifice.
50,1,6,Deus deorum,1,And the heavens shall declare his righteousness

50,1,9,Deus deorum,1,I will take no bullock out of thine house
50,1,9,Deus deorum,2,nor he-goat out of thy folds.
50,1,10,Deus deorum,1,For all the beasts of the forest are mine
50,1,10,Deus deorum,2,and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills.
50,1,11,Deus deorum,1,I know all the fowls upon the mountains
50,1,11,Deus deorum,2,and the wild beasts of the field are in my sight.
50,1,12,Deus deorum,1,"If I be hungry, I will not tell thee"
50,1,12,Deus deorum,2,"for the whole world is mine, and all that is therein."
50,1,13,Deus deorum,1,Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh
50,1,13,Deus deorum,2,and drink the blood of goats?
50,1,14,Deus deorum,1,Offer unto God thanksgiving
50,1,14,Deus deorum,2,and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
50,1,15,Deus deorum,1,And call upon me in the time of trouble
50,1,15,Deus deorum,2,"so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise me."
50,1,16,Deus deorum,1,But unto the ungodly said God
50,1,16,Deus deorum,2,"Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my covenant in thy mouth;"
50,1,17,Deus deorum,1,Whereas thou hatest to be reformed
50,1,17,Deus deorum,2,and hast cast my words behind thee?
50,1,18,Deus deorum,1,"When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him"
50,1,18,Deus deorum,2,and hast been partaker with the adulterers.
50,1,19,Deus deorum,1,Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness
50,1,19,Deus deorum,2,and with thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit.
50,1,20,Deus deorum,1,"Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother"
50,1,20,Deus deorum,2,"yea, and hast slandered thine own mother's son."
50,1,21,Deus deorum,1,"These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself"
50,1,21,Deus deorum,2,"but I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done."

53,1,2,Dixit insipiens,2,there is none that doeth good.
53,1,3,Dixit insipiens,1,God looked down from heaven upon the children of men

53,1,7,Dixit insipiens,2,O that the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!

55,1,10,"Exaudi, Deus",1,Day and night they go about within the walls thereof
55,1,10,"Exaudi, Deus",2,mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
55,1,11,"Exaudi, Deus",1,Wickedness is therein
55,1,11,"Exaudi, Deus",2,deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
55,1,12,"Exaudi, Deus",1,"For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour"

55,1,13,"Exaudi, Deus",1,"Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me"

66,1,4,Jubilate Deo,1,"O come hither, and behold the works of God"
66,1,4,Jubilate Deo,2,how wonderful he is in his doing toward the children of men.
66,1,5,Jubilate Deo,1,He turned the sea into dry land
66,1,5,Jubilate Deo,2,so that they went through the water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.
66,1,6,Jubilate Deo,1,He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people
66,1,6,Jubilate Deo,2,and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
66,1,7,Jubilate Deo,1,"O praise our God, ye people"
66,1,7,Jubilate Deo,2,and make the voice of his praise to be heard;

66,1,11,Jubilate Deo,2,"we went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place."
66,1,12,Jubilate Deo,1,I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings

66,1,14,Jubilate Deo,2,and I will tell you what he hath done for my soul.
66,1,15,Jubilate Deo,1,I called unto him with my mouth
66,1,15,Jubilate Deo,2,and gave him praises with my tongue.
66,1,16,Jubilate Deo,1,If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart
66,1,16,Jubilate Deo,2,the Lord will not hear me.

68,1,7,Exurgat Deus,1,"O God, when thou wentest forth before the people"
68,1,7,Exurgat Deus,2,when thou wentest through the wilderness;
68,1,8,Exurgat Deus,1,"The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God"
68,1,8,Exurgat Deus,2,"even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel."
68,1,9,Exurgat Deus,1,"Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance"
68,1,9,Exurgat Deus,2,and refreshedst it when it was weary.
68,1,10,Exurgat Deus,1,Thy congregation shall dwell therein
68,1,10,Exurgat Deus,2,"for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness prepared for the poor."
68,1,11,Exurgat Deus,1,The Lord gave the word
68,1,11,Exurgat Deus,2,great was the company of the preachers.
68,1,12,Exurgat Deus,1,"Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited"
68,1,12,Exurgat Deus,2,and they of the household divided the spoil.
68,1,13,Exurgat Deus,1,"Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove"
68,1,13,Exurgat Deus,2,"that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold."

68,1,22,Exurgat Deus,1,"The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan"

68,1,25,Exurgat Deus,1,"The singers go before, the minstrels follow after"
68,1,25,Exurgat Deus,2,in the midst are the damsels playing with the timbrels.
68,1,26,Exurgat Deus,1,"Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations"

68,1,30,Exurgat Deus,2,and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
68,1,31,Exurgat Deus,1,Then shall the princes come out of Egypt
68,1,31,Exurgat Deus,2,the Morians' land shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.

68,1,34,Exurgat Deus,2,his worship and strength is in the clouds.
68,1,35,Exurgat Deus,1,"O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places"

69,1,1,Salvum me fac,1,"SAVE me, O God"
69,1,1,Salvum me fac,2,"for the waters are come in, even unto my soul."
69,1,2,Salvum me fac,1,"I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is"
69,1,2,Salvum me fac,2,"I am come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me."
69,1,3,Salvum me fac,1,I am weary of crying; my throat is dry
69,1,3,Salvum me fac,2,my sight faileth me for waiting so long upon my God.
69,1,4,Salvum me fac,1,They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head
69,1,4,Salvum me fac,2,"they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty."
69,1,5,Salvum me fac,1,I paid them the things that I never took
69,1,5,Salvum me fac,2,"God, thou knowest my simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee."
69,1,6,Salvum me fac,1,"Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause"
69,1,6,Salvum me fac,2,"let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of Israel."
69,1,7,Salvum me fac,1,And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof
69,1,7,Salvum me fac,2,shame hath covered my face.
69,1,8,Salvum me fac,1,I am become a stranger unto my brethren
69,1,8,Salvum me fac,2,even an alien unto my mother's children.
69,1,9,Salvum me fac,1,For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me
69,1,9,Salvum me fac,2,and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
69,1,10,Salvum me fac,1,"I wept, and chastened myself with fasting"
69,1,10,Salvum me fac,2,and that was turned to my reproof.
69,1,11,Salvum me fac,1,I put on sackcloth also
69,1,11,Salvum me fac,2,and they jested upon me.
69,1,12,Salvum me fac,1,They that sit in the gate speak against me
69,1,12,Salvum me fac,2,and the drunkards make songs upon me.
69,1,13,Salvum me fac,1,"But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee"
69,1,13,Salvum me fac,2,in an acceptable time.
69,1,14,Salvum me fac,1,"Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy"
69,1,14,Salvum me fac,2,even in the truth of thy salvation.
69,1,15,Salvum me fac,1,"Take me out of the mire, that I sink not"
69,1,15,Salvum me fac,2,"O let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters."
69,1,16,Salvum me fac,1,"Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up"
69,1,16,Salvum me fac,2,and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
69,1,17,Salvum me fac,1,"Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable"
69,1,17,Salvum me fac,2,turn thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.
69,1,18,Salvum me fac,1,"And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble"
69,1,18,Salvum me fac,2,"O haste thee, and hear me."
69,1,19,Salvum me fac,1,"Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it"
69,1,19,Salvum me fac,2,"O deliver me, because of mine enemies."
69,1,20,Salvum me fac,1,"Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour"
69,1,20,Salvum me fac,2,mine adversaries are all in thy sight.
69,1,21,Salvum me fac,1,Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness
69,1,21,Salvum me fac,2,"I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me."
69,1,22,Salvum me fac,1,They gave me gall to eat
69,1,22,Salvum me fac,2,and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
69,1,23,Salvum me fac,1,Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal
69,1,23,Salvum me fac,2,and let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
69,1,24,Salvum me fac,1,"Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not"
69,1,24,Salvum me fac,2,and ever bow thou down their backs.
69,1,25,Salvum me fac,1,Pour out thine indignation upon them
69,1,25,Salvum me fac,2,and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold of them.
69,1,26,Salvum me fac,1,Let their habitation be void
69,1,26,Salvum me fac,2,and no man to dwell in their tents.
69,1,27,Salvum me fac,1,For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten
69,1,27,Salvum me fac,2,and they talk how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.
69,1,28,Salvum me fac,1,Let them fall from one wickedness to an-other
69,1,28,Salvum me fac,2,and not come into thy righteousness.
69,1,29,Salvum me fac,1,Let them be wiped out of the book of the living
69,1,29,Salvum me fac,2,and not be written among the righteous.
69,1,30,Salvum me fac,1,"As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness"
69,1,30,Salvum me fac,2,"thy help, O God, shall lift me up."
69,1,31,Salvum me fac,1,I will praise the Name of God with a song
69,1,31,Salvum me fac,2,and magnify it with thanksgiving.
69,1,32,Salvum me fac,1,This also shall please the Lord
69,1,32,Salvum me fac,2,better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
69,1,33,Salvum me fac,1,"The humble shall consider this, and be glad"
69,1,33,Salvum me fac,2,"seek ye after God, and your soul shall live."
69,1,34,Salvum me fac,1,For the Lord heareth the poor
69,1,34,Salvum me fac,2,and despiseth not his prisoners.
69,1,35,Salvum me fac,1,Let heaven and earth praise him
69,1,35,Salvum me fac,2,"the sea, and all that moveth therein."
69,1,36,Salvum me fac,1,"For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah"
69,1,36,Salvum me fac,2,"that men may dwell there, and have it in possession."
69,1,37,Salvum me fac,1,The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it
69,1,37,Salvum me fac,2,and they that love his Name shall dwell therein.

73,1,1,Quam bonus Israel!,1,TRULY God is loving unto Israel
73,1,1,Quam bonus Israel!,2,even unto such as are of a clean heart.
73,1,2,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone"
73,1,2,Quam bonus Israel!,2,my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
73,1,3,Quam bonus Israel!,1,And why? I was grieved at the wicked
73,1,3,Quam bonus Israel!,2,I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity.
73,1,4,Quam bonus Israel!,1,For they are in no peril of death
73,1,4,Quam bonus Israel!,2,but are lusty and strong.
73,1,5,Quam bonus Israel!,1,They come in no misfortune like other folk
73,1,5,Quam bonus Israel!,2,neither are they plagued like other men.
73,1,6,Quam bonus Israel!,1,And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride
73,1,6,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and overwhelmed with cruelty.
73,1,7,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Their eyes swell with fatness
73,1,7,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and they do even what they lust.
73,1,8,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy"
73,1,8,Quam bonus Israel!,2,their talking is against the most High.
73,1,9,Quam bonus Israel!,1,For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven
73,1,9,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and their tongue goeth through the world.
73,1,10,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Therefore fall the people unto them
73,1,10,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and thereout suck they no small advantage.
73,1,11,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Tush, say they, how should God perceive it"
73,1,11,Quam bonus Israel!,2,is there knowledge in the most High?
73,1,12,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in possession"
73,1,12,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed mine hands in innocency."
73,1,13,Quam bonus Israel!,1,All the day long have I been punished
73,1,13,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and chastened every morning.
73,1,14,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Yea, and I had almost said even as they"
73,1,14,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"but lo, then I should have condemned the generation of thy children."
73,1,15,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Then thought I to understand this
73,1,15,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"but it was too hard for me,"
73,1,16,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Until I went into the sanctuary of God
73,1,16,Quam bonus Israel!,2,then understood I the end of these men;
73,1,17,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places"
73,1,17,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"and castest them down, and destroyest them."
73,1,18,Quam bonus Israel!,1,O how suddenly do they consume
73,1,18,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"perish, and come to a fearful end!"
73,1,19,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh"
73,1,19,Quam bonus Israel!,2,so shalt thou make their image to vanish out of the city.
73,1,20,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Thus my heart was grieved
73,1,20,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and it went even through my reins.
73,1,21,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"So foolish was I, and ignorant"
73,1,21,Quam bonus Israel!,2,even as it were a beast before thee.
73,1,22,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"Nevertheless, I am alway by thee"
73,1,22,Quam bonus Israel!,2,for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
73,1,23,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel
73,1,23,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and after that receive me with glory.
73,1,24,Quam bonus Israel!,1,Whom have I in heaven but thee
73,1,24,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee.
73,1,25,Quam bonus Israel!,1,My flesh and my heart faileth
73,1,25,Quam bonus Israel!,2,"but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever."
73,1,26,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish"
73,1,26,Quam bonus Israel!,2,thou hast destroyed all them that commit fornication against thee.
73,1,27,Quam bonus Israel!,1,"But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God"
73,1,27,Quam bonus Israel!,2,and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.

74,1,12,"Ut quid, Deus?",2,why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?
74,1,13,"Ut quid, Deus?",1,For God is my King of old
74,1,13,"Ut quid, Deus?",2,the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
74,1,14,"Ut quid, Deus?",1,Thou didst divide the sea through thy power
74,1,14,"Ut quid, Deus?",2,thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
74,1,15,"Ut quid, Deus?",1,Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces
74,1,15,"Ut quid, Deus?",2,and gavest him to be meat for the people in the wilderness.
74,1,16,"Ut quid, Deus?",1,Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks
74,1,16,"Ut quid, Deus?",2,thou driedst up mighty waters.
74,1,17,"Ut quid, Deus?",1,"The day is thine, and the night is thine"

78,1,12,"Attendite, popule",1,But forgat what he had done
78,1,12,"Attendite, popule",2,and the wonderful works that he had shewed for them.
78,1,13,"Attendite, popule",1,"Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt"
78,1,13,"Attendite, popule",2,even in the field of Zoan.
78,1,14,"Attendite, popule",1,"He divided the sea, and let them go through"
78,1,14,"Attendite, popule",2,he made the waters to stand on an heap.
78,1,15,"Attendite, popule",1,In the day-time also he led them with a cloud
78,1,15,"Attendite, popule",2,and all the night through with a light of fire.
78,1,16,"Attendite, popule",1,He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness
78,1,16,"Attendite, popule",2,"and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth."
78,1,17,"Attendite, popule",1,He brought waters out of the stony rock
78,1,17,"Attendite, popule",2,so that it gushed out like the rivers.
78,1,18,"Attendite, popule",1,Yet for all this they sinned more against him
78,1,18,"Attendite, popule",2,and provoked the most Highest in the wilderness.
78,1,19,"Attendite, popule",1,They tempted God in their hearts
78,1,19,"Attendite, popule",2,and required meat for their lust.
78,1,20,"Attendite, popule",1,"They spake against God also, saying"
78,1,20,"Attendite, popule",2,Shall God prepare a table in the wilderness?
78,1,21,"Attendite, popule",1,"He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams flowed withal"
78,1,21,"Attendite, popule",2,"but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?"
78,1,22,"Attendite, popule",1,"When the Lord heard this, he was wroth"
78,1,22,"Attendite, popule",2,"so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;"
78,1,23,"Attendite, popule",1,Because they believed not in God
78,1,23,"Attendite, popule",2,and put not their trust in his help.
78,1,24,"Attendite, popule",1,So he commanded the clouds above
78,1,24,"Attendite, popule",2,and opened the doors of heaven.
78,1,25,"Attendite, popule",1,He rained down manna also upon them for to eat
78,1,25,"Attendite, popule",2,and gave them food from heaven.
78,1,26,"Attendite, popule",1,So man did eat angels' food
78,1,26,"Attendite, popule",2,for he sent them meat enough.
78,1,27,"Attendite, popule",1,He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven
78,1,27,"Attendite, popule",2,and through his power he brought in the south-west-wind.
78,1,28,"Attendite, popule",1,He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust
78,1,28,"Attendite, popule",2,and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
78,1,29,"Attendite, popule",1,He let it fall among their tents
78,1,29,"Attendite, popule",2,even round about their habitation.
78,1,30,"Attendite, popule",1,"So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire"
78,1,30,"Attendite, popule",2,they were not disappointed of their lust.
78,1,31,"Attendite, popule",1,"But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them"
78,1,31,"Attendite, popule",2,"yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel."
78,1,32,"Attendite, popule",1,But for all this they sinned yet more
78,1,32,"Attendite, popule",2,and believed not his wondrous works.
78,1,33,"Attendite, popule",1,Therefore their days did he consume in vanity
78,1,33,"Attendite, popule",2,and their years in trouble.
78,1,34,"Attendite, popule",1,"When he slew them, they sought him"
78,1,34,"Attendite, popule",2,"and turned them early, and inquired after God."
78,1,35,"Attendite, popule",1,And they remembered that God was their strength
78,1,35,"Attendite, popule",2,and that the high God was their redeemer.
78,1,36,"Attendite, popule",1,"Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth"
78,1,36,"Attendite, popule",2,and dissembled with him in their tongue.
78,1,37,"Attendite, popule",1,For their heart was not whole with him
78,1,37,"Attendite, popule",2,neither continued they stedfast in his covenant.
78,1,38,"Attendite, popule",1,"But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds"
78,1,38,"Attendite, popule",2,and destroyed them not.
78,1,39,"Attendite, popule",1,"Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away"
78,1,39,"Attendite, popule",2,and would not suffer his whole displeasure to arise.
78,1,40,"Attendite, popule",1,For he considered that they were but flesh
78,1,40,"Attendite, popule",2,"and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again."
78,1,41,"Attendite, popule",1,Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness
78,1,41,"Attendite, popule",2,and grieved him in the desert.
78,1,42,"Attendite, popule",1,"They turned back, and tempted God"
78,1,42,"Attendite, popule",2,and moved the Holy One in Israel.
78,1,43,"Attendite, popule",1,They thought not of his hand
78,1,43,"Attendite, popule",2,and of the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy;
78,1,44,"Attendite, popule",1,How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt
78,1,44,"Attendite, popule",2,and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
78,1,45,"Attendite, popule",1,He turned their waters into blood
78,1,45,"Attendite, popule",2,so that they might not drink of the rivers.
78,1,46,"Attendite, popule",1,"He sent lice among them, and devoured them up"
78,1,46,"Attendite, popule",2,and frogs to destroy them.
78,1,47,"Attendite, popule",1,He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar
78,1,47,"Attendite, popule",2,and their labour unto the grasshopper.
78,1,48,"Attendite, popule",1,He destroyed their vines with hail-stones
78,1,48,"Attendite, popule",2,and their mulberry trees with the frost.
78,1,49,"Attendite, popule",1,He smote their cattle also with hail-stones
78,1,49,"Attendite, popule",2,and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.
78,1,50,"Attendite, popule",1,"He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and trouble"
78,1,50,"Attendite, popule",2,and sent evil angels among them.
78,1,51,"Attendite, popule",1,"He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death"
78,1,51,"Attendite, popule",2,but gave their life over to the pestilence;
78,1,52,"Attendite, popule",1,And smote all the first-born in Egypt
78,1,52,"Attendite, popule",2,the most principal and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.
78,1,53,"Attendite, popule",1,"But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep"
78,1,53,"Attendite, popule",2,and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.
78,1,54,"Attendite, popule",1,"He brought them out safely, that they should not fear"
78,1,54,"Attendite, popule",2,and overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.
78,1,55,"Attendite, popule",1,And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary
78,1,55,"Attendite, popule",2,even to his mountain which he purchased with his right hand.
78,1,56,"Attendite, popule",1,He cast out the heathen also before them
78,1,56,"Attendite, popule",2,"caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."
78,1,57,"Attendite, popule",1,So they tempted and displeased the most high God
78,1,57,"Attendite, popule",2,and kept not his testimonies;
78,1,58,"Attendite, popule",1,"But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers"
78,1,58,"Attendite, popule",2,starting aside like a broken bow.
78,1,59,"Attendite, popule",1,For they grieved him with their hill-altars
78,1,59,"Attendite, popule",2,and provoked him to displeasure with their images.
78,1,60,"Attendite, popule",1,"When God heard this, he was wroth"
78,1,60,"Attendite, popule",2,and took sore displeasure at Israel.
78,1,61,"Attendite, popule",1,So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo
78,1,61,"Attendite, popule",2,even the tent that he had pitched among men.
78,1,62,"Attendite, popule",1,He delivered their power into captivity
78,1,62,"Attendite, popule",2,and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
78,1,63,"Attendite, popule",1,He gave his people over also unto the sword
78,1,63,"Attendite, popule",2,and was wroth with his inheritance.
78,1,64,"Attendite, popule",1,The fire consumed their young men
78,1,64,"Attendite, popule",2,and their maidens were not given to marriage.
78,1,65,"Attendite, popule",1,Their priests were slain with the sword
78,1,65,"Attendite, popule",2,and there were no widows to make lamentation.
78,1,66,"Attendite, popule",1,So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep
78,1,66,"Attendite, popule",2,and like a giant refreshed with wine.
78,1,67,"Attendite, popule",1,He smote his enemies in the hinder parts
78,1,67,"Attendite, popule",2,and put them to a perpetual shame.
78,1,68,"Attendite, popule",1,He refused the tabernacle of Joseph
78,1,68,"Attendite, popule",2,and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
78,1,69,"Attendite, popule",1,But chose the tribe of Judah
78,1,69,"Attendite, popule",2,even the hill of Sion which he loved.
78,1,70,"Attendite, popule",1,And there he built his temple on high
78,1,70,"Attendite, popule",2,and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath made continually.
78,1,71,"Attendite, popule",1,He chose David also his servant
78,1,71,"Attendite, popule",2,and took him away from the sheep-folds.
78,1,72,"Attendite, popule",1,As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him
78,1,72,"Attendite, popule",2,"that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance."
78,1,73,"Attendite, popule",1,So he fed them with a faithful and true heart
78,1,73,"Attendite, popule",2,and ruled them prudently with all his power.
78,2,75,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
78,2,75,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
78,2,74,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"

79,1,1,"Deus, venerunt",1,"O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance"
79,1,1,"Deus, venerunt",2,"thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones."
79,1,2,"Deus, venerunt",1,The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air
79,1,2,"Deus, venerunt",2,and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
79,1,3,"Deus, venerunt",1,Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem
79,1,3,"Deus, venerunt",2,and there was no man to bury them.
79,1,4,"Deus, venerunt",1,We are become an open shame to our enemies
79,1,4,"Deus, venerunt",2,a very scorn and derision unto them that are round about us.
79,1,5,"Deus, venerunt",1,"Lord, how long wilt thou be angry"
79,1,5,"Deus, venerunt",2,shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
79,1,6,"Deus, venerunt",1,Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee
79,1,6,"Deus, venerunt",2,and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
79,1,7,"Deus, venerunt",1,For they have devoured Jacob
79,1,7,"Deus, venerunt",2,and laid waste his dwelling-place.
79,1,8,"Deus, venerunt",1,"O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon"
79,1,8,"Deus, venerunt",2,for we are come to great misery.
79,1,9,"Deus, venerunt",1,"Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name"
79,1,9,"Deus, venerunt",2,"O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake."
79,1,10,"Deus, venerunt",1,Wherefore do the heathen say
79,1,10,"Deus, venerunt",2,Where is now their God?
79,1,11,"Deus, venerunt",1,O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed
79,1,11,"Deus, venerunt",2,be openly shewed upon the heathen in our sight.
79,1,12,"Deus, venerunt",1,O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee
79,1,12,"Deus, venerunt",2,"according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die."
79,1,13,"Deus, venerunt",1,And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee
79,1,13,"Deus, venerunt",2,"reward thou them, O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom."
79,1,14,"Deus, venerunt",1,"So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for ever"
79,1,14,"Deus, venerunt",2,and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to generation.
79,2,15,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father

80,1,1,Qui regis Israel,1,"HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep"
80,1,1,Qui regis Israel,2,"shew thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims."
80,1,2,Qui regis Israel,1,"Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses"
80,1,2,Qui regis Israel,2,"stir up thy strength, and come, and help us."
80,1,3,Qui regis Israel,1,"Turn us again, O God"
80,1,3,Qui regis Israel,2,"shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole."
80,1,4,Qui regis Israel,1,O Lord God of hosts
80,1,4,Qui regis Israel,2,how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
80,1,5,Qui regis Israel,1,Thou feedest them with the bread of tears
80,1,5,Qui regis Israel,2,and givest them plenteousness of tears to drink.
80,1,6,Qui regis Israel,1,Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours
80,1,6,Qui regis Israel,2,and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
80,1,7,Qui regis Israel,1,"Turn us again, thou God of hosts"
80,1,7,Qui regis Israel,2,"shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole."
80,1,8,Qui regis Israel,1,Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt
80,1,8,Qui regis Israel,2,"thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it."
80,1,9,Qui regis Israel,1,Thou madest room for it
80,1,9,Qui regis Israel,2,and when it had taken root it filled the land.
80,1,10,Qui regis Israel,1,The hills were covered with the shadow of it
80,1,10,Qui regis Israel,2,and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.
80,1,11,Qui regis Israel,1,She stretched out her branches unto the sea
80,1,11,Qui regis Israel,2,and her boughs unto the river.
80,1,12,Qui regis Israel,1,Why hast thou then broken down her hedge
80,1,12,Qui regis Israel,2,that all they that go by pluck off her grapes?
80,1,13,Qui regis Israel,1,The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up
80,1,13,Qui regis Israel,2,and the wild beasts of the field devour it.
80,1,14,Qui regis Israel,1,"Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven"
80,1,14,Qui regis Israel,2,"behold, and visit this vine;"
80,1,15,Qui regis Israel,1,And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted
80,1,15,Qui regis Israel,2,and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.
80,1,16,Qui regis Israel,1,"It is burnt with fire, and cut down"
80,1,16,Qui regis Israel,2,and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
80,1,17,Qui regis Israel,1,Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand
80,1,17,Qui regis Israel,2,"and upon the son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self."
80,1,18,Qui regis Israel,1,And so will not we go back from thee
80,1,18,Qui regis Israel,2,"O let us live, and we shall call upon thy Name."
80,1,19,Qui regis Israel,1,"Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts"
80,1,19,Qui regis Israel,2,"shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole."

81,1,1,Exultate Deo,1,SING we merrily unto God our strength
81,1,1,Exultate Deo,2,make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob.
81,1,2,Exultate Deo,1,"Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret"
81,1,2,Exultate Deo,2,the merry harp with the lute.
81,1,3,Exultate Deo,1,Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon
81,1,3,Exultate Deo,2,"even in the time appointed, and upon our solemn feast-day."
81,1,4,Exultate Deo,1,For this was made a statute for Israel
81,1,4,Exultate Deo,2,and a law of the God of Jacob.
81,1,5,Exultate Deo,1,This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony
81,1,5,Exultate Deo,2,"when he came out of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language."
81,1,6,Exultate Deo,1,I eased his shoulder from the burden
81,1,6,Exultate Deo,2,and his hands were delivered from making the pots.
81,1,7,Exultate Deo,1,"Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee"
81,1,7,Exultate Deo,2,and heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.
81,1,8,Exultate Deo,1,I proved thee also
81,1,8,Exultate Deo,2,at the waters of strife.
81,1,9,Exultate Deo,1,"Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel"
81,1,9,Exultate Deo,2,"if thou wilt hearken unto me,"
81,1,10,Exultate Deo,1,There shall no strange god be in thee
81,1,10,Exultate Deo,2,neither shalt thou worship any other god.
81,1,11,Exultate Deo,1,"I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt"
81,1,11,Exultate Deo,2,"open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it."
81,1,12,Exultate Deo,1,But my people would not hear my voice
81,1,12,Exultate Deo,2,and Israel would not obey me.
81,1,13,Exultate Deo,1,So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts
81,1,13,Exultate Deo,2,and let them follow their own imaginations.
81,1,14,Exultate Deo,1,O that my people would have hearkened unto me
81,1,14,Exultate Deo,2,"for if Israel had walked in my ways,"
81,1,15,Exultate Deo,1,I should soon have put down their enemies
81,1,15,Exultate Deo,2,and turned my hand against their adversaries.
81,1,16,Exultate Deo,1,The haters of the Lord should have been found liars
81,1,16,Exultate Deo,2,but their time should have endured for ever.
81,1,17,Exultate Deo,1,He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour
81,1,17,Exultate Deo,2,and with honey out of the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

83,1,2,"Deus, quis similis?",2,and they that hate thee have lift up their head.

83,1,9,"Deus, quis similis?",2,"unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the brook of Kison;"
83,1,10,"Deus, quis similis?",1,Who perished at Endor
83,1,10,"Deus, quis similis?",2,and became as the dung of the earth.

83,1,13,"Deus, quis similis?",1,"O my God, make them like unto a wheel"
83,1,13,"Deus, quis similis?",2,and as the stubble before the wind;

89,1,19,Misericordias Domini,2,the Holy One of Israel is our King.
89,1,20,Misericordias Domini,1,"Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst"
89,1,20,Misericordias Domini,2,I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
89,1,21,Misericordias Domini,1,I have found David my servant
89,1,21,Misericordias Domini,2,with my holy oil have I anointed him.
89,1,22,Misericordias Domini,1,My hand shall hold him fast
89,1,22,Misericordias Domini,2,and my arm shall strengthen him.
89,1,23,Misericordias Domini,1,The enemy shall not be able to do him violence
89,1,23,Misericordias Domini,2,the son of wickedness shall not hurt him.
89,1,24,Misericordias Domini,1,I will smite down his foes before his face
89,1,24,Misericordias Domini,2,and plague them that hate him.
89,1,25,Misericordias Domini,1,My truth also and my mercy shall be with him
89,1,25,Misericordias Domini,2,and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
89,1,26,Misericordias Domini,1,I will set his dominion also in the sea
89,1,26,Misericordias Domini,2,and his right hand in the floods.
89,1,27,Misericordias Domini,1,"He shall call me, Thou art my Father"
89,1,27,Misericordias Domini,2,"my God, and my strong salvation."
89,1,28,Misericordias Domini,1,And I will make him my first-born
89,1,28,Misericordias Domini,2,higher than the kings of the earth.
89,1,29,Misericordias Domini,1,My mercy will I keep for him for evermore
89,1,29,Misericordias Domini,2,and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
89,1,30,Misericordias Domini,1,His seed also will I make to endure for ever
89,1,30,Misericordias Domini,2,and his throne as the days of heaven.
89,1,31,Misericordias Domini,1,But if his children forsake my law
89,1,31,Misericordias Domini,2,and walk not in my judgements;
89,1,32,Misericordias Domini,1,"If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments"
89,1,32,Misericordias Domini,2,"I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges."
89,1,33,Misericordias Domini,1,"Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him"
89,1,33,Misericordias Domini,2,nor suffer my truth to fail.
89,1,34,Misericordias Domini,1,"My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips"
89,1,34,Misericordias Domini,2,"I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David."
89,1,35,Misericordias Domini,1,His seed shall endure for ever
89,1,35,Misericordias Domini,2,and his seat is like as the sun before me.
89,1,36,Misericordias Domini,1,He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon
89,1,36,Misericordias Domini,2,and as the faithful witness in heaven.
89,1,37,Misericordias Domini,1,But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed
89,1,37,Misericordias Domini,2,and art displeased at him.
89,1,38,Misericordias Domini,1,Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant
89,1,38,Misericordias Domini,2,and cast his crown to the ground.
89,1,39,Misericordias Domini,1,Thou hast overthrown all his hedges
89,1,39,Misericordias Domini,2,and broken down his strong holds.
89,1,40,Misericordias Domini,1,All they that go by spoil him
89,1,40,Misericordias Domini,2,and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
89,1,41,Misericordias Domini,1,Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies
89,1,41,Misericordias Domini,2,and made all his adversaries to rejoice.
89,1,42,Misericordias Domini,1,Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword
89,1,42,Misericordias Domini,2,and givest him not victory in the battle.
89,1,43,Misericordias Domini,1,Thou hast put out his glory
89,1,43,Misericordias Domini,2,and cast his throne down to the ground.
89,1,44,Misericordias Domini,1,The days of his youth hast thou shortened
89,1,44,Misericordias Domini,2,and covered him with dishonour.
89,1,45,Misericordias Domini,1,"Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever"
89,1,45,Misericordias Domini,2,and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
89,1,46,Misericordias Domini,1,O remember how short my time is
89,1,46,Misericordias Domini,2,wherefore hast thou made all men for nought?
89,1,47,Misericordias Domini,1,"What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death"
89,1,47,Misericordias Domini,2,and shall he deliver his soul from the hand of hell?
89,1,48,Misericordias Domini,1,"Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses"
89,1,48,Misericordias Domini,2,which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
89,1,49,Misericordias Domini,1,"Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have"
89,1,49,Misericordias Domini,2,and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;
89,1,50,Misericordias Domini,1,"Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of thine Anointed"

90,1,3,"Domine, refugium",2,"again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men."
90,1,4,"Domine, refugium",1,For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yester-day
90,1,4,"Domine, refugium",2,seeing that is past as a watch in the night.
90,1,5,"Domine, refugium",1,As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep

90,1,7,"Domine, refugium",2,and are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.
90,1,8,"Domine, refugium",1,Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee
90,1,8,"Domine, refugium",2,and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
90,1,9,"Domine, refugium",1,For when thou art angry all our days are gone

101,1,1,Misericordiam et judicium,1,MY song shall be of mercy and judgement
101,1,1,Misericordiam et judicium,2,"unto thee, O Lord, will I sing."
101,1,2,Misericordiam et judicium,1,O let me have understanding
101,1,2,Misericordiam et judicium,2,in the way of godliness.
101,1,3,Misericordiam et judicium,1,When wilt thou come unto me
101,1,3,Misericordiam et judicium,2,I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
101,1,4,Misericordiam et judicium,1,I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness
101,1,4,Misericordiam et judicium,2,there shall no such cleave unto me.
101,1,5,Misericordiam et judicium,1,A froward heart shall depart from me
101,1,5,Misericordiam et judicium,2,I will not know a wicked person.
101,1,6,Misericordiam et judicium,1,Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour
101,1,6,Misericordiam et judicium,2,him will I destroy.
101,1,7,Misericordiam et judicium,1,Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach
101,1,7,Misericordiam et judicium,2,I will not suffer him.
101,1,8,Misericordiam et judicium,1,Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land
101,1,8,Misericordiam et judicium,2,that they may dwell with me.
101,1,9,Misericordiam et judicium,1,Whoso leadeth a godly life
101,1,9,Misericordiam et judicium,2,he shall be my servant.
101,1,10,Misericordiam et judicium,1,There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house
101,1,10,Misericordiam et judicium,2,he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
101,1,11,Misericordiam et judicium,1,I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land
101,1,11,Misericordiam et judicium,2,that I may root out all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.
101,2,13,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father

102,1,1,"Domine, exaudi",1,"HEAR my prayer, O Lord"
102,1,1,"Domine, exaudi",2,and let my crying come unto thee.
102,1,2,"Domine, exaudi",1,Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble
102,1,2,"Domine, exaudi",2,"incline thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon."
102,1,3,"Domine, exaudi",1,For my days are consumed away like smoke
102,1,3,"Domine, exaudi",2,and my bones are burnt up as it were a fire-brand.
102,1,4,"Domine, exaudi",1,"My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass"
102,1,4,"Domine, exaudi",2,so that I forget to eat my bread.
102,1,5,"Domine, exaudi",1,For the voice of my groaning
102,1,5,"Domine, exaudi",2,my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
102,1,6,"Domine, exaudi",1,I am become like a pelican in the wilderness
102,1,6,"Domine, exaudi",2,and like an owl that is in the desert.
102,1,7,"Domine, exaudi",1,"I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow"
102,1,7,"Domine, exaudi",2,that sitteth alone upon the house-top.
102,1,8,"Domine, exaudi",1,Mine enemies revile me all the day long
102,1,8,"Domine, exaudi",2,and they that are mad upon me are sworn together against me.
102,1,9,"Domine, exaudi",1,For I have eaten ashes as it were bread
102,1,9,"Domine, exaudi",2,and mingled my drink with weeping;
102,1,10,"Domine, exaudi",1,And that because of thine indignation and wrath
102,1,10,"Domine, exaudi",2,"for thou hast taken me up, and cast me down."
102,1,11,"Domine, exaudi",1,My days are gone like a shadow
102,1,11,"Domine, exaudi",2,and I am withered like grass.
102,1,12,"Domine, exaudi",1,"But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever"
102,1,12,"Domine, exaudi",2,and thy remembrance throughout all generations.
102,1,13,"Domine, exaudi",1,"Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion"
102,1,13,"Domine, exaudi",2,"for it is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come."
102,1,14,"Domine, exaudi",1,And why? thy servants think upon her stones
102,1,14,"Domine, exaudi",2,and it pitieth them to see her in the dust.
102,1,15,"Domine, exaudi",1,"The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord"
102,1,15,"Domine, exaudi",2,and all the kings of the earth thy majesty;
102,1,16,"Domine, exaudi",1,When the Lord shall build up Sion
102,1,16,"Domine, exaudi",2,and when his glory shall appear;
102,1,17,"Domine, exaudi",1,When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute
102,1,17,"Domine, exaudi",2,and despiseth not their desire.
102,1,18,"Domine, exaudi",1,This shall be written for those that come after
102,1,18,"Domine, exaudi",2,and the people which shall be born shall praise the Lord.
102,1,19,"Domine, exaudi",1,For he hath looked down from his sanctuary
102,1,19,"Domine, exaudi",2,out of the heaven did the Lord behold the earth;
102,1,20,"Domine, exaudi",1,That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity
102,1,20,"Domine, exaudi",2,and deliver the children appointed unto death;
102,1,21,"Domine, exaudi",1,That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion
102,1,21,"Domine, exaudi",2,and his worship at Jerusalem;
102,1,22,"Domine, exaudi",1,When the people are gathered together
102,1,22,"Domine, exaudi",2,"and the kingdoms also, to serve the Lord."
102,1,23,"Domine, exaudi",1,He brought down my strength in my journey
102,1,23,"Domine, exaudi",2,and shortened my days.
102,1,24,"Domine, exaudi",1,"But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age"
102,1,24,"Domine, exaudi",2,"as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations."
102,1,25,"Domine, exaudi",1,"Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth"
102,1,25,"Domine, exaudi",2,and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
102,1,26,"Domine, exaudi",1,"They shall perish, but thou shalt endure"
102,1,26,"Domine, exaudi",2,they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
102,1,27,"Domine, exaudi",1,"And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed"
102,1,27,"Domine, exaudi",2,"but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
102,1,28,"Domine, exaudi",1,The children of thy servants shall continue
102,1,28,"Domine, exaudi",2,and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight.
102,2,29,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
102,2,29,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
102,2,30,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"

103,1,1,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"PRAISE the Lord, O my soul"
103,1,1,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
103,1,2,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"Praise the Lord, O my soul"
103,1,2,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and forget not all his benefits;
103,1,3,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Who forgiveth all thy sin
103,1,3,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and healeth all thine infirmities;
103,1,4,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Who saveth thy life from destruction
103,1,4,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness;
103,1,5,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things
103,1,5,"Benedic, anima mea",2,making thee young and lusty as an eagle.
103,1,6,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement
103,1,6,"Benedic, anima mea",2,for all them that are oppressed with wrong.
103,1,7,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He shewed his ways unto Moses
103,1,7,"Benedic, anima mea",2,his works unto the children of Israel.
103,1,8,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The Lord is full of compassion and mercy
103,1,8,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"long-suffering, and of great goodness."
103,1,9,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He will not alway be chiding
103,1,9,"Benedic, anima mea",2,neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
103,1,10,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He hath not dealt with us after our sins
103,1,10,"Benedic, anima mea",2,nor rewarded us according to our wickednesses.
103,1,11,"Benedic, anima mea",1,For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth
103,1,11,"Benedic, anima mea",2,so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.
103,1,12,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Look how wide also the east is from the west
103,1,12,"Benedic, anima mea",2,so far hath he set our sins from us.
103,1,13,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children"
103,1,13,"Benedic, anima mea",2,even so is the Lord merciful unto them that fear him.
103,1,14,"Benedic, anima mea",1,For he knoweth whereof we are made
103,1,14,"Benedic, anima mea",2,he remembereth that we are but dust.
103,1,15,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The days of man are but as grass
103,1,15,"Benedic, anima mea",2,for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
103,1,16,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone"
103,1,16,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and the place thereof shall know it no more.
103,1,17,"Benedic, anima mea",1,But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that fear him
103,1,17,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and his righteousness upon children's children;
103,1,18,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Even upon such as keep his covenant
103,1,18,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and think upon his commandments to do them.
103,1,19,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven
103,1,19,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and his kingdom ruleth over all.
103,1,20,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength"
103,1,20,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words."
103,1,21,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts"
103,1,21,"Benedic, anima mea",2,ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
103,1,22,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion"
103,1,22,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"praise thou the Lord, O my soul."
103,2,23,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father

104,1,1,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"PRAISE the Lord, O my soul"
104,1,1,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour."
104,1,2,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment
104,1,2,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.
104,1,3,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters
104,1,3,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"and maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind."
104,1,4,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He maketh his angels spirits
104,1,4,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and his ministers a flaming fire.
104,1,5,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He laid the foundations of the earth
104,1,5,"Benedic, anima mea",2,that it never should move at any time.
104,1,6,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment
104,1,6,"Benedic, anima mea",2,the waters stand in the hills.
104,1,7,"Benedic, anima mea",1,At thy rebuke they flee
104,1,7,"Benedic, anima mea",2,at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
104,1,8,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath"
104,1,8,"Benedic, anima mea",2,even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.
104,1,9,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass
104,1,9,"Benedic, anima mea",2,neither turn again to cover the earth.
104,1,10,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He sendeth the springs into the rivers
104,1,10,"Benedic, anima mea",2,which run among the hills.
104,1,11,"Benedic, anima mea",1,All beasts of the field drink thereof
104,1,11,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and the wild asses quench their thirst.
104,1,12,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation
104,1,12,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and sing among the branches.
104,1,13,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He watereth the hills from above
104,1,13,"Benedic, anima mea",2,the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
104,1,14,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He bringeth forth grass for the cattle
104,1,14,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and green herb for the service of men;
104,1,15,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man"
104,1,15,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen man's heart."
104,1,16,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The trees of the Lord also are full of sap
104,1,16,"Benedic, anima mea",2,even the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted;
104,1,17,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Wherein the birds make their nests
104,1,17,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
104,1,18,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats
104,1,18,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and so are the stony rocks for the conies.
104,1,19,"Benedic, anima mea",1,He appointed the moon for certain seasons
104,1,19,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and the sun knoweth his going down.
104,1,20,"Benedic, anima mea",1,Thou makest darkness that it may be night
104,1,20,"Benedic, anima mea",2,wherein all the beasts of the forest do move.
104,1,21,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The lions roaring after their prey
104,1,21,"Benedic, anima mea",2,do seek their meat from God.
104,1,22,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"The sun ariseth, and they get them away together"
104,1,22,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and lay them down in their dens.
104,1,23,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour"
104,1,23,"Benedic, anima mea",2,until the evening.
104,1,24,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"O Lord, how manifold are thy works"
104,1,24,"Benedic, anima mea",2,in wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.
104,1,25,"Benedic, anima mea",1,So is the great and wide sea also
104,1,25,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts."
104,1,26,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan"
104,1,26,"Benedic, anima mea",2,whom thou hast made to take his pastime therein.
104,1,27,"Benedic, anima mea",1,These wait all upon thee
104,1,27,"Benedic, anima mea",2,that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
104,1,28,"Benedic, anima mea",1,When thou givest it them they gather it
104,1,28,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and when thou openest thy hand they are filled with good.
104,1,29,"Benedic, anima mea",1,When thou hidest thy face they are troubled
104,1,29,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"when thou takest away their breath they die, and are turned again to their dust."
104,1,30,"Benedic, anima mea",1,When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made
104,1,30,"Benedic, anima mea",2,and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
104,1,31,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever
104,1,31,"Benedic, anima mea",2,the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
104,1,32,"Benedic, anima mea",1,The earth shall tremble at the look of him
104,1,32,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"if he do but touch the hills, they shall smoke."
104,1,33,"Benedic, anima mea",1,I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live
104,1,33,"Benedic, anima mea",2,I will praise my God while I have my being.
104,1,34,"Benedic, anima mea",1,And so shall my words please him
104,1,34,"Benedic, anima mea",2,my joy shall be in the Lord.
104,1,35,"Benedic, anima mea",1,"As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall come to an end"
104,1,35,"Benedic, anima mea",2,"praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord."
104,2,37,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father

105,1,1,Confitemini Domino,1,"O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name"
105,1,1,Confitemini Domino,2,tell the people what things he hath done.
105,1,2,Confitemini Domino,1,"O let your songs be of him, and praise him"
105,1,2,Confitemini Domino,2,and let your talking be of all his wondrous works.
105,1,3,Confitemini Domino,1,Rejoice in his holy Name
105,1,3,Confitemini Domino,2,let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
105,1,4,Confitemini Domino,1,Seek the Lord and his strength
105,1,4,Confitemini Domino,2,seek his face evermore.
105,1,5,Confitemini Domino,1,Remember the marvellous works that he hath done
105,1,5,Confitemini Domino,2,"his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth,"
105,1,6,Confitemini Domino,1,O ye seed of Abraham his servant
105,1,6,Confitemini Domino,2,ye children of Jacob his chosen.
105,1,7,Confitemini Domino,1,He is the Lord our God
105,1,7,Confitemini Domino,2,his judgements are in all the world.
105,1,8,Confitemini Domino,1,He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise
105,1,8,Confitemini Domino,2,that he made to a thousand generations;
105,1,9,Confitemini Domino,1,Even the covenant that he made with Abraham
105,1,9,Confitemini Domino,2,and the oath that he sware unto Isaac;
105,1,10,Confitemini Domino,1,And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law
105,1,10,Confitemini Domino,2,and to Israel for an everlasting testament;
105,1,11,Confitemini Domino,1,"Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan"
105,1,11,Confitemini Domino,2,the lot of your inheritance;
105,1,12,Confitemini Domino,1,When there were yet but a few of them
105,1,12,Confitemini Domino,2,and they strangers in the land;
105,1,13,Confitemini Domino,1,What time as they went from one nation to another
105,1,13,Confitemini Domino,2,from one kingdom to another people;
105,1,14,Confitemini Domino,1,He suffered no man to do them wrong
105,1,14,Confitemini Domino,2,but reproved even kings for their sakes;
105,1,15,Confitemini Domino,1,Touch not mine Anointed
105,1,15,Confitemini Domino,2,and do my prophets no harm.
105,1,16,Confitemini Domino,1,"Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land"
105,1,16,Confitemini Domino,2,and destroyed all the provision of bread.
105,1,17,Confitemini Domino,1,But he had sent a man before them
105,1,17,Confitemini Domino,2,"even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servant;"
105,1,18,Confitemini Domino,1,Whose feet they hurt in the stocks
105,1,18,Confitemini Domino,2,the iron entered into his soul;
105,1,19,Confitemini Domino,1,Until the time came that his cause was known
105,1,19,Confitemini Domino,2,the word of the Lord tried him.
105,1,20,Confitemini Domino,1,"The king sent, and delivered him"
105,1,20,Confitemini Domino,2,the prince of the people let him go free.
105,1,21,Confitemini Domino,1,He made him lord also of his house
105,1,21,Confitemini Domino,2,and ruler of all his substance;
105,1,22,Confitemini Domino,1,That he might inform his princes after his will
105,1,22,Confitemini Domino,2,and teach his senators wisdom.
105,1,23,Confitemini Domino,1,Israel also came into Egypt
105,1,23,Confitemini Domino,2,and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
105,1,24,Confitemini Domino,1,And he increased his people exceedingly
105,1,24,Confitemini Domino,2,and made them stronger than their enemies;
105,1,25,Confitemini Domino,1,"Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people"
105,1,25,Confitemini Domino,2,and dealt untruly with his servants.
105,1,26,Confitemini Domino,1,Then sent he Moses his servant
105,1,26,Confitemini Domino,2,and Aaron whom he had chosen.
105,1,27,Confitemini Domino,1,And these shewed his tokens among them
105,1,27,Confitemini Domino,2,and wonders in the land of Ham.
105,1,28,Confitemini Domino,1,"He sent darkness, and it was dark"
105,1,28,Confitemini Domino,2,and they were not obedient unto his word.
105,1,29,Confitemini Domino,1,He turned their waters into blood
105,1,29,Confitemini Domino,2,and slew their fish.
105,1,30,Confitemini Domino,1,Their land brought forth frogs
105,1,30,Confitemini Domino,2,"yea, even in their kings' chambers."
105,1,31,Confitemini Domino,1,"He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies"
105,1,31,Confitemini Domino,2,and lice in all their quarters.
105,1,32,Confitemini Domino,1,He gave them hail-stones for rain
105,1,32,Confitemini Domino,2,and flames of fire in their land.
105,1,33,Confitemini Domino,1,He smote their vines also and fig-trees
105,1,33,Confitemini Domino,2,and destroyed the trees that were in their coasts.
105,1,34,Confitemini Domino,1,"He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable"
105,1,34,Confitemini Domino,2,"and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground."
105,1,35,Confitemini Domino,1,He smote all the first-born in their land
105,1,35,Confitemini Domino,2,even the chief of all their strength.
105,1,36,Confitemini Domino,1,He brought them forth also with silver and gold
105,1,36,Confitemini Domino,2,there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
105,1,37,Confitemini Domino,1,Egypt was glad at their departing
105,1,37,Confitemini Domino,2,for they were afraid of them.
105,1,38,Confitemini Domino,1,He spread out a cloud to be a covering
105,1,38,Confitemini Domino,2,and fire to give light in the night-season.
105,1,39,Confitemini Domino,1,At their desire he brought quails
105,1,39,Confitemini Domino,2,and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
105,1,40,Confitemini Domino,1,"He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out"
105,1,40,Confitemini Domino,2,so that rivers ran in the dry places.
105,1,41,Confitemini Domino,1,For why? he remembered his holy promise
105,1,41,Confitemini Domino,2,and Abraham his servant.
105,1,42,Confitemini Domino,1,And he brought forth his people with joy
105,1,42,Confitemini Domino,2,and his chosen with gladness;
105,1,43,Confitemini Domino,1,And gave them the lands of the heathen
105,1,43,Confitemini Domino,2,and they took the labours of the people in possession;
105,1,44,Confitemini Domino,1,That they might keep his statutes
105,1,44,Confitemini Domino,2,and observe his laws.
105,2,45,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
105,2,45,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
105,2,46,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"
105,2,46,Doxology,2,world without end. Amen.
106,1,1,Confitemini Domino,1,"O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious"
106,1,1,Confitemini Domino,2,and his mercy endureth for ever.
106,1,2,Confitemini Domino,1,Who can express the noble acts of the Lord
106,1,2,Confitemini Domino,2,or shew forth all his praise?
106,1,3,Confitemini Domino,1,Blessed are they that alway keep judgement
106,1,3,Confitemini Domino,2,and do righteousness.
106,1,4,Confitemini Domino,1,"Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy people"
106,1,4,Confitemini Domino,2,O visit me with thy salvation;
106,1,5,Confitemini Domino,1,That I may see the felicity of thy chosen
106,1,5,Confitemini Domino,2,"and rejoice in the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance."
106,1,6,Confitemini Domino,1,We have sinned with our fathers
106,1,6,Confitemini Domino,2,"we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly."
106,1,7,Confitemini Domino,1,"Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness in remembrance"
106,1,7,Confitemini Domino,2,"but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red sea."
106,1,8,Confitemini Domino,1,"Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake"
106,1,8,Confitemini Domino,2,that he might make his power to be known.
106,1,9,Confitemini Domino,1,"He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up"
106,1,9,Confitemini Domino,2,"so he led them through the deep, as through a wilderness."
106,1,10,Confitemini Domino,1,And he saved them from the adversaries' hand
106,1,10,Confitemini Domino,2,and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.
106,1,11,Confitemini Domino,1,"As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them"
106,1,11,Confitemini Domino,2,there was not one of them left.
106,1,12,Confitemini Domino,1,Then believed they his words
106,1,12,Confitemini Domino,2,and sang praise unto him.
106,1,13,Confitemini Domino,1,But within a while they forgat his works
106,1,13,Confitemini Domino,2,and would not abide his counsel.
106,1,14,Confitemini Domino,1,But lust came upon them in the wilderness
106,1,14,Confitemini Domino,2,and they tempted God in the desert.
106,1,15,Confitemini Domino,1,And he gave them their desire
106,1,15,Confitemini Domino,2,and sent leanness withal into their soul.
106,1,16,Confitemini Domino,1,They angered Moses also in the tents
106,1,16,Confitemini Domino,2,and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
106,1,17,Confitemini Domino,1,"So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan"
106,1,17,Confitemini Domino,2,and covered the congregation of Abiram.
106,1,18,Confitemini Domino,1,And the fire was kindled in their company
106,1,18,Confitemini Domino,2,the flame burnt up the ungodly.
106,1,19,Confitemini Domino,1,They made a calf in Horeb
106,1,19,Confitemini Domino,2,and worshipped the molten image.
106,1,20,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus they turned their glory
106,1,20,Confitemini Domino,2,into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
106,1,21,Confitemini Domino,1,And they forgat God their Saviour
106,1,21,Confitemini Domino,2,who had done so great things in Egypt;
106,1,22,Confitemini Domino,1,Wondrous works in the land of Ham
106,1,22,Confitemini Domino,2,and fearful things by the Red sea.
106,1,23,Confitemini Domino,1,"So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap"
106,1,23,Confitemini Domino,2,"to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them."
106,1,24,Confitemini Domino,1,"Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land"
106,1,24,Confitemini Domino,2,and gave no credence unto his word;
106,1,25,Confitemini Domino,1,But murmured in their tents
106,1,25,Confitemini Domino,2,and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
106,1,26,Confitemini Domino,1,Then lift he up his hand against them
106,1,26,Confitemini Domino,2,to overthrow them in the wilderness;
106,1,27,Confitemini Domino,1,To cast out their seed among the nations
106,1,27,Confitemini Domino,2,and to scatter them in the lands.
106,1,28,Confitemini Domino,1,They joined themselves unto Baal-peor
106,1,28,Confitemini Domino,2,and ate the offerings of the dead.
106,1,29,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions
106,1,29,Confitemini Domino,2,and the plague was great among them.
106,1,30,Confitemini Domino,1,Then stood up Phinees and prayed
106,1,30,Confitemini Domino,2,and so the plague ceased.
106,1,31,Confitemini Domino,1,And that was counted unto him for righteousness
106,1,31,Confitemini Domino,2,among all posterities for evermore.
106,1,32,Confitemini Domino,1,They angered him also at the waters of strife
106,1,32,Confitemini Domino,2,so that he punished Moses for their sakes;
106,1,33,Confitemini Domino,1,Because they provoked his spirit
106,1,33,Confitemini Domino,2,so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
106,1,34,Confitemini Domino,1,Neither destroyed they the heathen
106,1,34,Confitemini Domino,2,as the Lord commanded them;
106,1,35,Confitemini Domino,1,But were mingled among the heathen
106,1,35,Confitemini Domino,2,and learned their works.
106,1,36,Confitemini Domino,1,"Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay"
106,1,36,Confitemini Domino,2,"yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;"
106,1,37,Confitemini Domino,1,"And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters"
106,1,37,Confitemini Domino,2,whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.
106,1,38,Confitemini Domino,1,Thus were they stained with their own works
106,1,38,Confitemini Domino,2,and went a whoring with their own inventions.
106,1,39,Confitemini Domino,1,Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people
106,1,39,Confitemini Domino,2,insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
106,1,40,Confitemini Domino,1,And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen
106,1,40,Confitemini Domino,2,and they that hated them were lords over them.
106,1,41,Confitemini Domino,1,Their enemies oppressed them
106,1,41,Confitemini Domino,2,and had them in subjection.
106,1,42,Confitemini Domino,1,Many a time did he deliver them
106,1,42,Confitemini Domino,2,"but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness."
106,1,43,Confitemini Domino,1,"Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity"
106,1,43,Confitemini Domino,2,he heard their complaint.
106,1,44,Confitemini Domino,1,"He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of his mercies"
106,1,44,Confitemini Domino,2,"yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity them."
106,1,45,Confitemini Domino,1,"Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen"
106,1,45,Confitemini Domino,2,"that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise."
106,1,46,Confitemini Domino,1,Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end
106,1,46,Confitemini Domino,2,"and let all the people say, Amen."
106,2,47,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
106,2,47,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
106,2,48,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"
106,2,48,Doxology,2,world without end. Amen.
107,1,1,Confitemini Domino,1,"O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious"
107,1,1,Confitemini Domino,2,and his mercy endureth for ever.
107,1,2,Confitemini Domino,1,Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed
107,1,2,Confitemini Domino,2,and delivered from the hand of the enemy;
107,1,3,Confitemini Domino,1,"And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west"
107,1,3,Confitemini Domino,2,from the north and from the south.
107,1,4,Confitemini Domino,1,They went astray in the wilderness out of the way
107,1,4,Confitemini Domino,2,and found no city to dwell in;
107,1,5,Confitemini Domino,1,Hungry and thirsty
107,1,5,Confitemini Domino,2,their soul fainted in them.
107,1,6,Confitemini Domino,1,So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble
107,1,6,Confitemini Domino,2,and he delivered them from their distress.
107,1,7,Confitemini Domino,1,He led them forth by the right way
107,1,7,Confitemini Domino,2,that they might go to the city where they dwelt.
107,1,8,Confitemini Domino,1,O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness
107,1,8,Confitemini Domino,2,and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
107,1,9,Confitemini Domino,1,For he satisfieth the empty soul
107,1,9,Confitemini Domino,2,and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
107,1,10,Confitemini Domino,1,"Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death"
107,1,10,Confitemini Domino,2,being fast bound in misery and iron;
107,1,11,Confitemini Domino,1,Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord
107,1,11,Confitemini Domino,2,and lightly regarded the counsel of the most Highest;
107,1,12,Confitemini Domino,1,He also brought down their heart through heaviness
107,1,12,Confitemini Domino,2,"they fell down, and there was none to help them."
107,1,13,Confitemini Domino,1,So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble
107,1,13,Confitemini Domino,2,he delivered them out of their distress.
107,1,14,Confitemini Domino,1,"For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death"
107,1,14,Confitemini Domino,2,and brake their bonds in sunder.
107,1,15,Confitemini Domino,1,O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness
107,1,15,Confitemini Domino,2,and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
107,1,16,Confitemini Domino,1,For he hath broken the gates of brass
107,1,16,Confitemini Domino,2,and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
107,1,17,Confitemini Domino,1,Foolish men are plagued for their offence
107,1,17,Confitemini Domino,2,and because of their wickedness.
107,1,18,Confitemini Domino,1,Their soul abhorred all manner of meat
107,1,18,Confitemini Domino,2,and they were even hard at death's door.
107,1,19,Confitemini Domino,1,So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble
107,1,19,Confitemini Domino,2,he delivered them out of their distress.
107,1,20,Confitemini Domino,1,"He sent his word, and healed them"
107,1,20,Confitemini Domino,2,and they were saved from their destruction.
107,1,21,Confitemini Domino,1,O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness
107,1,21,Confitemini Domino,2,and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
107,1,22,Confitemini Domino,1,That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving
107,1,22,Confitemini Domino,2,and tell out his works with gladness!
107,1,23,Confitemini Domino,1,They that go down to the sea in ships
107,1,23,Confitemini Domino,2,and occupy their business in great waters;
107,1,24,Confitemini Domino,1,These men see the works of the Lord
107,1,24,Confitemini Domino,2,and his wonders in the deep.
107,1,25,Confitemini Domino,1,For at his word the stormy wind ariseth
107,1,25,Confitemini Domino,2,which lifteth up the waves thereof.
107,1,26,Confitemini Domino,1,"They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep"
107,1,26,Confitemini Domino,2,their soul melteth away because of the trouble.
107,1,27,Confitemini Domino,1,"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man"
107,1,27,Confitemini Domino,2,and are at their wits' end.
107,1,28,Confitemini Domino,1,So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble
107,1,28,Confitemini Domino,2,he delivereth them out of their distress.
107,1,29,Confitemini Domino,1,For he maketh the storm to cease
107,1,29,Confitemini Domino,2,so that the waves thereof are still.
107,1,30,Confitemini Domino,1,"Then are they glad, because they are at rest"
107,1,30,Confitemini Domino,2,and so he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.
107,1,31,Confitemini Domino,1,O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness
107,1,31,Confitemini Domino,2,and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
107,1,32,Confitemini Domino,1,That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people
107,1,32,Confitemini Domino,2,and praise him in the seat of the elders!
107,1,33,Confitemini Domino,1,Who turneth the floods into a wilderness
107,1,33,Confitemini Domino,2,and drieth up the water-springs.
107,1,34,Confitemini Domino,1,A fruitful land maketh he barren
107,1,34,Confitemini Domino,2,for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
107,1,35,Confitemini Domino,1,"Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water"
107,1,35,Confitemini Domino,2,and water-springs of a dry ground.
107,1,36,Confitemini Domino,1,And there he setteth the hungry
107,1,36,Confitemini Domino,2,that they may build them a city to dwell in;
107,1,37,Confitemini Domino,1,"That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards"
107,1,37,Confitemini Domino,2,to yield them fruits of increase.
107,1,38,Confitemini Domino,1,He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly
107,1,38,Confitemini Domino,2,and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
107,1,39,Confitemini Domino,1,"And again, when they are minished and brought low"
107,1,39,Confitemini Domino,2,"through oppression, through any plague or trouble;"
107,1,40,Confitemini Domino,1,Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants
107,1,40,Confitemini Domino,2,and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;
107,1,41,Confitemini Domino,1,Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery
107,1,41,Confitemini Domino,2,and maketh him households like a flock of sheep.
107,1,42,Confitemini Domino,1,"The righteous will consider this, and rejoice"
107,1,42,Confitemini Domino,2,and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped.
107,1,43,Confitemini Domino,1,Whoso is wise will ponder these things
107,1,43,Confitemini Domino,2,and they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.
107,2,45,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
107,2,45,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
107,2,44,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"
107,2,44,Doxology,2,world without end. Amen.
108,1,1,Paratum cor meum,1,"O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready"
108,1,1,Paratum cor meum,2,I will sing and give praise with the best member that I have.
108,1,2,Paratum cor meum,1,"Awake, thou lute, and harp"
108,1,2,Paratum cor meum,2,I myself will awake right early.
108,1,3,Paratum cor meum,1,"I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people"
108,1,3,Paratum cor meum,2,I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
108,1,4,Paratum cor meum,1,For thy mercy is greater than the heavens
108,1,4,Paratum cor meum,2,and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
108,1,5,Paratum cor meum,1,"Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens"
108,1,5,Paratum cor meum,2,and thy glory above all the earth.
108,1,6,Paratum cor meum,1,That thy beloved may be delivered
108,1,6,Paratum cor meum,2,"let thy right hand save them, and hear thou me."
108,1,7,Paratum cor meum,1,God hath spoken in his holiness
108,1,7,Paratum cor meum,2,"I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and mete out the valley of Succoth."
108,1,8,Paratum cor meum,1,"Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine"
108,1,8,Paratum cor meum,2,Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
108,1,9,Paratum cor meum,1,"Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot"
108,1,9,Paratum cor meum,2,"over Edom will I cast out my shoe, upon Philistia will I triumph."
108,1,10,Paratum cor meum,1,Who will lead me into the strong city
108,1,10,Paratum cor meum,2,and who will bring me into Edom?
108,1,11,Paratum cor meum,1,"Hast not thou forsaken us, O God"
108,1,11,Paratum cor meum,2,"and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?"
108,1,12,Paratum cor meum,1,O help us against the enemy
108,1,12,Paratum cor meum,2,for vain is the help of man.
108,1,13,Paratum cor meum,1,Through God we shall do great acts
108,1,13,Paratum cor meum,2,and it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
108,2,15,Doxology,1,Glory be to the Father
108,2,15,Doxology,2,"and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost"
108,2,14,Doxology,1,"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be"
108,2,14,Doxology,2,world without end. Amen.
109,1,1,"Deus, laudem",1,"HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise"
109,1,1,"Deus, laudem",2,"for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me."
109,1,2,"Deus, laudem",1,And they have spoken against me with false tongues
109,1,2,"Deus, laudem",2,"they compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause."
109,1,3,"Deus, laudem",1,"For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part"
109,1,3,"Deus, laudem",2,but I give myself unto prayer.
109,1,4,"Deus, laudem",1,Thus have they rewarded me evil for good
109,1,4,"Deus, laudem",2,and hatred for my good will.
109,1,5,"Deus, laudem",1,Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him
109,1,5,"Deus, laudem",2,and let Satan stand at his right hand.
109,1,6,"Deus, laudem",1,"When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned"
109,1,6,"Deus, laudem",2,and let his prayer be turned into sin.
109,1,7,"Deus, laudem",1,Let his days be few
109,1,7,"Deus, laudem",2,and let another take his office.
109,1,8,"Deus, laudem",1,Let his children be fatherless
109,1,8,"Deus, laudem",2,and his wife a widow.
109,1,9,"Deus, laudem",1,"Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread"
109,1,9,"Deus, laudem",2,let them seek it also out of desolate places.
109,1,10,"Deus, laudem",1,Let the extortioner consume all that he hath
109,1,10,"Deus, laudem",2,and let the stranger spoil his labour.
109,1,11,"Deus, laudem",1,Let there be no man to pity him
109,1,11,"Deus, laudem",2,nor to have compassion upon his fatherless children.
109,1,12,"Deus, laudem",1,Let his posterity be destroyed
109,1,12,"Deus, laudem",2,and in the next generation let his name be clean put out.
109,1,13,"Deus, laudem",1,Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord
109,1,13,"Deus, laudem",2,and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
109,1,14,"Deus, laudem",1,Let them alway be before the Lord
109,1,14,"Deus, laudem",2,that he may root out the memorial of them from off the earth.
109,1,15,"Deus, laudem",1,"And that, because his mind was not to do good"
109,1,15,"Deus, laudem",2,"but persecuted the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart."
109,1,16,"Deus, laudem",1,"His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him"
109,1,16,"Deus, laudem",2,"he loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him."
109,1,17,"Deus, laudem",1,"He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment"
109,1,17,"Deus, laudem",2,"and it shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones."
109,1,18,"Deus, laudem",1,Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him
109,1,18,"Deus, laudem",2,and as the girdle that he is alway girded withal.
109,1,19,"Deus, laudem",1,Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies

141,1,5,"Domine, clamavi",1,Let the righteous rather smite me friendly
141,1,5,"Domine, clamavi",2,and reprove me.

142,1,3,Voce mea ad Dominum,2,in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
142,1,4,Voce mea ad Dominum,1,I looked also upon my right hand
142,1,4,Voce mea ad Dominum,2,and saw there was no man that would know me.
142,1,5,Voce mea ad Dominum,1,I had no place to flee unto
142,1,5,Voce mea ad Dominum,2,and no man cared for my soul.

142,1,7,Voce mea ad Dominum,1,Consider my complaint
142,1,7,Voce mea ad Dominum,2,for I am brought very low.
142,1,8,Voce mea ad Dominum,1,O deliver me from my persecutors

142,1,9,Voce mea ad Dominum,1,"Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name"

143,1,2,"Domine, exaudi",1,And enter not into judgement with thy servant
143,1,2,"Domine, exaudi",2,for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

143,1,6,"Domine, exaudi",1,I stretch forth my hands unto thee
143,1,6,"Domine, exaudi",2,my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
143,1,7,"Domine, exaudi",1,"Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint"
143,1,7,"Domine, exaudi",2,"hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit."
143,1,8,"Domine, exaudi",1,"O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust"
143,1,8,"Domine, exaudi",2,"shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee."
143,1,9,"Domine, exaudi",1,"Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies"
