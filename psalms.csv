40	1	Expectans expectavi	16	O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me	make haste, O Lord, to help me.	8	Morning
40	1	Expectans expectavi	17	Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to destroy it	let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me evil.	8	Morning
40	1	Expectans expectavi	18	Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame	that say unto me, Fie upon thee, fie upon thee.	8	Morning
40	1	Expectans expectavi	19	Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee	and let such as love thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.	8	Morning

70	1	Deus, in adjutorium	4	But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee	and let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.	13	Evening
70	1	Deus, in adjutorium	5	As for me, I am poor and in misery	haste thee unto me, O God.	13	Evening
70	1	Deus, in adjutorium	6	Thou art my helper and my redeemer	O Lord, make no long tarrying.	13	Evening
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	1	IN thee, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion	but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save me.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	2	Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort	thou hast promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	3	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly	out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	4	For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for	thou art my hope, even from my youth.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	5	Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born	thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	6	I am become as it were a monster unto many	but my sure trust is in thee.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	7	O let my mouth be filled with thy praise	that I may sing of thy glory and honour all the day long.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	8	Cast me not away in the time of age	forsake me not when my strength faileth me.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	9	For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their counsel together, saying	God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	10	Go not far from me, O God	my God, haste thee to help me.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	11	Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul	let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	12	As for me, I will patiently abide alway	and will praise thee more and more.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	13	My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation	for I know no end thereof.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	14	I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God	and will make mention of thy righteousness only.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	15	Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now	therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	16	Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed	until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yet for to come.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	17	Thy righteousness, O God, is very high	and great things are they that thou hast done; O God, who is like unto thee?	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	18	O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou turn and refresh me	yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth again.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	19	Thou hast brought me to great honour	and comforted me on every side.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	20	Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an instrument of musick	unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	21	My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee	and so will my soul whom thou hast delivered.	14	Morning
71	1	In te, Domine, speravi	22	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long	for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	1	GIVE the King thy judgements, O God	and thy righteousness unto the King's son.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	2	Then shall he judge thy people according unto right	and defend the poor.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	3	The mountains also shall bring peace	and the little hills righteousness unto the people.	14	Morning

72	1	Deus, judicium	5	They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth	from one generation to another.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	6	He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool	even as the drops that water the earth.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	7	In his time shall the righteous flourish	yea, and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	8	His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other	and from the flood unto the world's end.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him	his enemies shall lick the dust.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	10	The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents	the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	11	All kings shall fall down before him	all nations shall do him service.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	12	For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth	the needy also, and him that hath no helper.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	13	He shall be favourable to the simple and needy	and shall preserve the souls of the poor.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	14	He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong	and dear shall their blood be in his sight.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	15	He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia	prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	16	There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills	his fruit shall shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	17	His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the posterities	which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall praise him.	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	18	Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel	which only doeth wondrous things;	14	Morning
72	1	Deus, judicium	19	And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever	and all the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.	14	Morning
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	1	TRULY God is loving unto Israel	even unto such as are of a clean heart.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	2	Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone	my treadings had well-nigh slipt.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	3	And why? I was grieved at the wicked	I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	4	For they are in no peril of death	but are lusty and strong.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	5	They come in no misfortune like other folk	neither are they plagued like other men.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	6	And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride	and overwhelmed with cruelty.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	7	Their eyes swell with fatness	and they do even what they lust.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	8	They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy	their talking is against the most High.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	9	For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven	and their tongue goeth through the world.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	10	Therefore fall the people unto them	and thereout suck they no small advantage.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	11	Tush, say they, how should God perceive it	is there knowledge in the most High?	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	12	Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in possession	and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed mine hands in innocency.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	13	All the day long have I been punished	and chastened every morning.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	14	Yea, and I had almost said even as they	but lo, then I should have condemned the generation of thy children.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	15	Then thought I to understand this	but it was too hard for me,	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	16	Until I went into the sanctuary of God	then understood I the end of these men;	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	17	Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places	and castest them down, and destroyest them.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	18	O how suddenly do they consume	perish, and come to a fearful end!	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	19	Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh	so shalt thou make their image to vanish out of the city.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	20	Thus my heart was grieved	and it went even through my reins.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	21	So foolish was I, and ignorant	even as it were a beast before thee.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	22	Nevertheless, I am alway by thee	for thou hast holden me by my right hand.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	23	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel	and after that receive me with glory.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	24	Whom have I in heaven but thee	and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	25	My flesh and my heart faileth	but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	26	For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish	thou hast destroyed all them that commit fornication against thee.	14	Evening
73	1	Quam bonus Israel!	27	But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God	and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	1	O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long	why is thy wrath so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	2	O think upon thy congregation	whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	3	Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance	and mount Sion, wherein thou hast dwelt.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	4	Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy	which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	5	Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations	and set up their banners for tokens.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	6	He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees	was known to bring it to an excellent work.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	7	But now they break down all the carved work thereof	with axes and hammers.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	8	They have set fire upon thy holy places	and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	9	Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havock of them altogether	thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	10	We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more	no, not one is there among us, that understandeth any more.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	11	O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour	how long shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name, for ever?	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	12	Why withdrawest thou thy hand	why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	13	For God is my King of old	the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	14	Thou didst divide the sea through thy power	thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	15	Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces	and gavest him to be meat for the people in the wilderness.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	16	Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks	thou driedst up mighty waters.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	17	The day is thine, and the night is thine	thou hast prepared the light and the sun.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	18	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth	thou hast made summer and winter.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	19	Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked	and how the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	20	O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies	and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	21	Look upon the covenant	for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel habitations.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	22	O let not the simple go away ashamed	but let the poor and needy give praise unto thy Name.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	23	Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause	remember how the foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.	14	Evening
74	1	Ut quid, Deus?	24	Forget not the voice of thine enemies	the presumption of them that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.	14	Evening
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	1	UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks	yea, unto thee do we give thanks.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	2	Thy Name also is so nigh	and that do thy wondrous works declare.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	3	When I receive the congregation	I shall judge according unto right.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	4	The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof	I bear up the pillars of it.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	5	I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly	and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	6	Set not up your horn on high	and speak not with a stiff neck.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	7	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west	nor yet from the south.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	8	And why? God is the Judge	he putteth down one, and setteth up another.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	9	For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red	it is full mixed, and he poureth out of the same.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	10	As for the dregs thereof	all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck them out.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	11	But I will talk of the God of Jacob	and praise him for ever.	15	Morning
75	1	Confitebimur tibi	12	All the horns of the ungodly also will I break	and the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	1	IN Jewry is God known	his Name is great in Israel.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	2	At Salem is his tabernacle	and his dwelling in Sion.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	3	There brake he the arrows of the bow	the shield, the sword, and the battle.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	4	Thou art of more honour and might	than the hills of the robbers.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	5	The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep	and all the men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob	both the chariot and horse are fallen.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	7	Thou, even thou art to be feared	and who may stand in thy sight when thou art angry?	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	8	Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven	the earth trembled, and was still;	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	9	When God arose to judgement	and to help all the meek upon earth.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	10	The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise	and the fierceness of them shalt thou refrain.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	11	Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him	bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.	15	Morning
76	1	Notus in Judaea	12	He shall refrain the spirit of princes	and is wonderful among the kings of the earth.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	1	I WILL cry unto God with my voice	even unto God will I cry with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	2	In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord	my sore ran and ceased not in the night-season; my soul refused comfort.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	3	When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God	when my heart is vexed, I will complain.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking	I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	5	I have considered the days of old	and the years that are past.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	6	I call to remembrance my song	and in the night I commune with mine own heart, and search out my spirits.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	7	Will the Lord absent himself for ever	and will he be no more intreated?	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever	and is his promise come utterly to an end for evermore?	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious	and will he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure?	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	10	And I said, It is mine own infirmity	but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most Highest.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	11	I will remember the works of the Lord	and call to mind thy wonders of old time.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	12	I will think also of all thy works	and my talking shall be of thy doings.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	13	Thy way, O God, is holy	who is so great a God as our God?	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	14	Thou art the God that doeth wonders	and hast declared thy power among the people.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	15	Thou hast mightily delivered thy people	even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid	the depths also were troubled.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	17	The clouds poured out water, the air thundered	and thine arrows went abroad.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	18	The voice of thy thunder was heard round about	the lightnings shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters	and thy footsteps are not known.	15	Morning
77	1	Voce mea ad Dominum	20	Thou leddest thy people like sheep	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	15	Morning
78	1	Attendite, popule	1	HEAR my law, O my people	incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	2	I will open my mouth in a parable	I will declare hard sentences of old;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	3	Which we have heard and known	and such as our fathers have told us;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	4	That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come	but to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he hath done.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	5	He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law	which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	6	That their posterity might know it	and the children which were yet unborn;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	7	To the intent that when they came up	they might shew their children the same;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	8	That they might put their trust in God	and not to forget the works of God, but to keep his commandments;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	9	And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation	a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not stedfastly unto God;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	10	Like as the children of Ephraim	who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	11	They kept not the covenant of God	and would not walk in his law;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	12	But forgat what he had done	and the wonderful works that he had shewed for them.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	13	Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt	even in the field of Zoan.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	14	He divided the sea, and let them go through	he made the waters to stand on an heap.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	15	In the day-time also he led them with a cloud	and all the night through with a light of fire.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	16	He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness	and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	17	He brought waters out of the stony rock	so that it gushed out like the rivers.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	18	Yet for all this they sinned more against him	and provoked the most Highest in the wilderness.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	19	They tempted God in their hearts	and required meat for their lust.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	20	They spake against God also, saying	Shall God prepare a table in the wilderness?	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	21	He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams flowed withal	but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	22	When the Lord heard this, he was wroth	so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	23	Because they believed not in God	and put not their trust in his help.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	24	So he commanded the clouds above	and opened the doors of heaven.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	25	He rained down manna also upon them for to eat	and gave them food from heaven.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	26	So man did eat angels' food	for he sent them meat enough.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	27	He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven	and through his power he brought in the south-west-wind.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	28	He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust	and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	29	He let it fall among their tents	even round about their habitation.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	30	So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire	they were not disappointed of their lust.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	31	But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them	yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	32	But for all this they sinned yet more	and believed not his wondrous works.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity	and their years in trouble.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	34	When he slew them, they sought him	and turned them early, and inquired after God.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	35	And they remembered that God was their strength	and that the high God was their redeemer.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	36	Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth	and dissembled with him in their tongue.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	37	For their heart was not whole with him	neither continued they stedfast in his covenant.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	38	But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds	and destroyed them not.	15	Evening
78	1	Attendite, popule	39	Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away	and would not suffer his whole displeasure to arise.	15	Evening

102	1	Domine, exaudi	1	HEAR my prayer, O Lord	and let my crying come unto thee.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	2	Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble	incline thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	3	For my days are consumed away like smoke	and my bones are burnt up as it were a fire-brand.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	4	My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass	so that I forget to eat my bread.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	5	For the voice of my groaning	my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	6	I am become like a pelican in the wilderness	and like an owl that is in the desert.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	7	I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow	that sitteth alone upon the house-top.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	8	Mine enemies revile me all the day long	and they that are mad upon me are sworn together against me.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	9	For I have eaten ashes as it were bread	and mingled my drink with weeping;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	10	And that because of thine indignation and wrath	for thou hast taken me up, and cast me down.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	11	My days are gone like a shadow	and I am withered like grass.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	12	But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever	and thy remembrance throughout all generations.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	13	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion	for it is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	14	And why? thy servants think upon her stones	and it pitieth them to see her in the dust.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	15	The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord	and all the kings of the earth thy majesty;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	16	When the Lord shall build up Sion	and when his glory shall appear;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	17	When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute	and despiseth not their desire.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	18	This shall be written for those that come after	and the people which shall be born shall praise the Lord.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	19	For he hath looked down from his sanctuary	out of the heaven did the Lord behold the earth;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	20	That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity	and deliver the children appointed unto death;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	21	That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion	and his worship at Jerusalem;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	22	When the people are gathered together	and the kingdoms also, to serve the Lord.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	23	He brought down my strength in my journey	and shortened my days.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	24	But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age	as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	25	Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth	and the heavens are the work of thy hands.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure	they all shall wax old as doth a garment;	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	27	And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed	but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.	20	Morning
102	1	Domine, exaudi	28	The children of thy servants shall continue	and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight.	20	Morning

103	1	Benedic, anima mea	10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins	nor rewarded us according to our wickednesses.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	11	For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth	so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	12	Look how wide also the east is from the west	so far hath he set our sins from us.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	13	Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children	even so is the Lord merciful unto them that fear him.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	14	For he knoweth whereof we are made	he remembereth that we are but dust.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	15	The days of man are but as grass	for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	16	For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone	and the place thereof shall know it no more.	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	17	But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that fear him	and his righteousness upon children's children;	20	Morning
103	1	Benedic, anima mea	18	Even upon such as keep his covenant	and think upon his commandments to do them.	20	Morning

104	1	Benedic, anima mea	8	They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath	even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.	20	Evening
104	1	Benedic, anima mea	9	Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass	neither turn again to cover the earth.	20	Evening
104	1	Benedic, anima mea	10	He sendeth the springs into the rivers	which run among the hills.	20	Evening
104	1	Benedic, anima mea	11	All beasts of the field drink thereof	and the wild asses quench their thirst.	20	Evening
104	1	Benedic, anima mea	12	Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation	and sing among the branches.	20	Evening
104	1	Benedic, anima mea	13	He watereth the hills from above	the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.	20	Evening

105	1	Confitemini Domino	1	O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name	tell the people what things he hath done.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	2	O let your songs be of him, and praise him	and let your talking be of all his wondrous works.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	3	Rejoice in his holy Name	let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	4	Seek the Lord and his strength	seek his face evermore.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	5	Remember the marvellous works that he hath done	his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth,	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant	ye children of Jacob his chosen.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	7	He is the Lord our God	his judgements are in all the world.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	8	He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise	that he made to a thousand generations;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	9	Even the covenant that he made with Abraham	and the oath that he sware unto Isaac;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	10	And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law	and to Israel for an everlasting testament;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan	the lot of your inheritance;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	12	When there were yet but a few of them	and they strangers in the land;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	13	What time as they went from one nation to another	from one kingdom to another people;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	14	He suffered no man to do them wrong	but reproved even kings for their sakes;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	15	Touch not mine Anointed	and do my prophets no harm.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	16	Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land	and destroyed all the provision of bread.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	17	But he had sent a man before them	even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servant;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	18	Whose feet they hurt in the stocks	the iron entered into his soul;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	19	Until the time came that his cause was known	the word of the Lord tried him.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	20	The king sent, and delivered him	the prince of the people let him go free.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	21	He made him lord also of his house	and ruler of all his substance;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	22	That he might inform his princes after his will	and teach his senators wisdom.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	23	Israel also came into Egypt	and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	24	And he increased his people exceedingly	and made them stronger than their enemies;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	25	Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people	and dealt untruly with his servants.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	26	Then sent he Moses his servant	and Aaron whom he had chosen.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	27	And these shewed his tokens among them	and wonders in the land of Ham.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	28	He sent darkness, and it was dark	and they were not obedient unto his word.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	29	He turned their waters into blood	and slew their fish.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	30	Their land brought forth frogs	yea, even in their kings' chambers.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	31	He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies	and lice in all their quarters.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	32	He gave them hail-stones for rain	and flames of fire in their land.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	33	He smote their vines also and fig-trees	and destroyed the trees that were in their coasts.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	34	He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable	and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	35	He smote all the first-born in their land	even the chief of all their strength.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	36	He brought them forth also with silver and gold	there was not one feeble person among their tribes.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	37	Egypt was glad at their departing	for they were afraid of them.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	38	He spread out a cloud to be a covering	and fire to give light in the night-season.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	39	At their desire he brought quails	and he filled them with the bread of heaven.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	40	He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out	so that rivers ran in the dry places.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	41	For why? he remembered his holy promise	and Abraham his servant.	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	42	And he brought forth his people with joy	and his chosen with gladness;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	43	And gave them the lands of the heathen	and they took the labours of the people in possession;	21	Morning
105	1	Confitemini Domino	44	That they might keep his statutes	and observe his laws.	21	Morning
106	1	Confitemini Domino	1	O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious	and his mercy endureth for ever.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	2	Who can express the noble acts of the Lord	or shew forth all his praise?	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	3	Blessed are they that alway keep judgement	and do righteousness.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	4	Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy people	O visit me with thy salvation;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	5	That I may see the felicity of thy chosen	and rejoice in the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	6	We have sinned with our fathers	we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	7	Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness in remembrance	but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red sea.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	8	Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake	that he might make his power to be known.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up	so he led them through the deep, as through a wilderness.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	10	And he saved them from the adversaries' hand	and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	11	As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them	there was not one of them left.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	12	Then believed they his words	and sang praise unto him.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	13	But within a while they forgat his works	and would not abide his counsel.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	14	But lust came upon them in the wilderness	and they tempted God in the desert.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	15	And he gave them their desire	and sent leanness withal into their soul.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	16	They angered Moses also in the tents	and Aaron the saint of the Lord.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	17	So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan	and covered the congregation of Abiram.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	18	And the fire was kindled in their company	the flame burnt up the ungodly.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	19	They made a calf in Horeb	and worshipped the molten image.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	20	Thus they turned their glory	into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	21	And they forgat God their Saviour	who had done so great things in Egypt;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham	and fearful things by the Red sea.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	23	So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap	to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	24	Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land	and gave no credence unto his word;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	25	But murmured in their tents	and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	26	Then lift he up his hand against them	to overthrow them in the wilderness;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	27	To cast out their seed among the nations	and to scatter them in the lands.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	28	They joined themselves unto Baal-peor	and ate the offerings of the dead.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions	and the plague was great among them.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	30	Then stood up Phinees and prayed	and so the plague ceased.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness	among all posterities for evermore.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	32	They angered him also at the waters of strife	so that he punished Moses for their sakes;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	33	Because they provoked his spirit	so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	34	Neither destroyed they the heathen	as the Lord commanded them;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	35	But were mingled among the heathen	and learned their works.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	36	Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay	yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	37	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters	whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	38	Thus were they stained with their own works	and went a whoring with their own inventions.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	39	Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people	insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	40	And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen	and they that hated them were lords over them.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	41	Their enemies oppressed them	and had them in subjection.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	42	Many a time did he deliver them	but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	43	Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity	he heard their complaint.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	44	He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of his mercies	yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity them.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	45	Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen	that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.	21	Evening
106	1	Confitemini Domino	46	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end	and let all the people say, Amen.	21	Evening
107	1	Confitemini Domino	1	O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious	and his mercy endureth for ever.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	2	Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed	and delivered from the hand of the enemy;	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west	from the north and from the south.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	4	They went astray in the wilderness out of the way	and found no city to dwell in;	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	5	Hungry and thirsty	their soul fainted in them.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	6	So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble	and he delivered them from their distress.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	7	He led them forth by the right way	that they might go to the city where they dwelt.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	8	O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness	and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	9	For he satisfieth the empty soul	and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	10	Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death	being fast bound in misery and iron;	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	11	Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord	and lightly regarded the counsel of the most Highest;	22	Morning
107	1	Confitemini Domino	12	He also brought down their heart through heaviness	they fell down, and there was none to help them.	22	Morning
